It is amazing how the first description and the last differ so much! \r\n\r\nYou don't need to be a great artist to enjoy this fun and free drawing game - we love stick figures and anything that gets the message across!

Our flappy friend migrated to another amusement island further in the south, where you can find the coolest mini golf tracks placed on an exotic beach.  Many trucks are littered with old clay pots that could obstruct your way.  Smash them to free your way to the hole. As the bird has a huge passion for mini golf but there are no golf clubs (sticks) and balls to play with, he has reinvented some parts of  the game concept.\r\nHe blows up his clumsy body until he looks like a ball and uses a slingshot to move towards the hole.\r\nAfter the first shot the game play will change from slingshot modus to arrow modus with a power bar, for a more precise stroke.\r\nAdvice: Remember that the first hit will be the most difficult, so do not put too much strength in it because it will simply make our fluffy friend, fly out of the track.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Awesome 3D graphics\r\n- Cute animal characters and animations\r\n- 4 amazing courses with over 70 holes\r\n- Simple, drag-and-release gameplay mechanic for the slingshot\r\n- Direction arrow with power bar for the successive par\r\n- Realistic physics and ball movement\r\n- Collectible fruit like, bananas and water melon to increase your score\r\n- Easy and funny to play\r\n\r\nTry to find the shortest and easiest path to the hole in order to rise your score. If you can make it with no more than 3 par (hits) you will get three stars.\r\nThere are also collectible bananas and Water melon slices that can increase your final score.\r\n\r\nIf you collect one water melon piece you will get back one par (hit) which means that you have higher possibilities to get 3 stars.\r\n\r\nJoin this crazy bird on his holiday at the beach and have some real fun playing this epic game.\r\n\r\nChallenge your friends and show them who the king of the trucks is!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDD6R5","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Finger Shark","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58601.9007199266386280.96c06c00-6c6b-4925-820c-ea7ca273726e.0b2cfa35-b8dc-466c-854d-5101e5f10211","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["1824C3AD.FingerShark_xcb6zpf0p1p46"],"ContentIds":["1a219e48-bd8c-07c2-7e0c-32ae019b4b97"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Touch the screen and watch the shark rush to bite your finger/cursor!\r\nChange out different shark skins and background scenes!\r\nLet your own 3D shark chase your finger/cursor around the screen, dont let it get too close or it will bite!\r\nMiniGame: Play as a shark swimming through a dangerous cave.\r\nToggle the interface on and off.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n3D\r\nSkins/Backgrounds\r\nBlood!!!\r\n\r\nBackgrounds used -

We specialize in educational games with the fun built right into them.\r\n\r\nLet's do the rest of the description in a question-and-answer form.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ How is the game played? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nIn the first lesson, children listen to the names of colors while a fun brush puts a big splash of the color on an easel, accompanied by an entertaining sound effect that makes the splash against the easel sound real.\r\n\r\nThen children learn how to recognize colors with a series of colorful jellyfish that float down with likable expressions on their faces. The pleasant lady announcer asks kids to choose the blue, yellow, purple, or black jellyfish. Each time children choose the correct one, she congratulates them with encouraging words like \"Perfect!\" and \"You're Good!\"\r\n\r\nNext, children discover how to build their color memories. An identical, pretty design shows up on the screen in rows. When kids tap on one of the designs, a color is revealed. Then the color disappears behind the design. Kids keep tapping until they remember where some of the colors are. Then when they tap on a design that matches one of the colors they remember the location of, they go back and tap it.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ What will my children learn? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nLike all Intellijoy games, the game focuses on a specific educational lesson, so children and their parents find the game really inviting and distraction-free.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, your child will learn:\r\n\r\n✔ The names of colors by splashing colors onto an easel.\r\n\r\n✔ How to recognize colors by being asked to do things like \"Choose the purple jellyfish.\"\r\n\r\n✔ Build memory skills by matching a color they've just seen.\r\n\r\nWe love to hear from parents – and from children, too.

remember the day of the invasion well. The memories still burn deeply, like spicy chicken wings.\r\n\r\n\"They came without warning, squawking menacingly, their ruffled feathers darkening the sun. Invading intergalactic chickens, out to punish humanity for our oppression of their earthly brethren.\r\n\r\n\"I instantly knew what had to be done. I dropped my half-eaten chicken burger and jumped in my cockpit. With a greasy finger I set my lasers to \"extra crispy\" and blasted off to intercept the fowl invaders.\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't easy. Squawks, feathers flying, the smell of charred chicken everywhere. Three times they invaded, each time with increasingly devious plans. Three times I managed to push them back whence they came, and secure humanity a few more years as the dominant species of this planet.\r\n\r\n\"After their last retreat, I headed for my local Space Burger to bask in the glow of my recent victory. Breathing a sigh of relief, I sat down to enjoy a double chicken-burger with crispy chicken wings on the side.\r\n\r\n\"Little did I know that my greatest adventure was yet to come...\"\r\n\r\n\"Ultimate Omelette\" is the title of the fourth episode in the Chicken Invaders series of casual space shooter games. The game puts players at the forefront of a battle against invading intergalactic chickens, bent on revenge against the human race for our oppression of Earth chickens. In this episode, the chickens have constructed a gigantic cannon capable of launching planet-scale eggs against Earth, with the ultimate goal of encrusting humanity in an impenetrable wall made of egg white. Joined by an unlikely ally, players will travel to foreign, unexplored galaxies in an effort to locate and destroy the egg cannon before it reaches Earth.\r\n\r\nThe enemy repertoire has been significantly broadened, introducing several different kinds of chickens which attack relentlessly in colorful groups and meticulously choreographed formations. The chicken fray is punctuated by fights against boss enemies spanning up to three times the size of the screen. The arsenal at the player's disposal has also been correspondingly extended, with three new weapons and four kinds of supporting satellites providing additional firepower. The player's intergalactic journey is also accentuated by unique fantastic scenarios, such as navigating through a field of gigantic floating feathers, or dodging molten planet chunks during a supernova explosion.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

Recall your childhood!\r\n\r\nLudo game that traces its lineage to 6th century India. Ludo is derived from game Pachisi. Ludo is also very similar to Spanish board game.\r\n\r\nLudo game has stayed popular throughout the ages, varying only a little in its game structure. This persevering game is now available for you to play in an all new modernized format, i.e. as a video game application.\r\n\r\nThe game is played between 2 to 4 players and you have the option of playing the game against the computer, against your friends, or even against people from around the world. The objective of the game is pretty straightforward; each player gets 4 tokens, these tokens must make a full turn of the board and then make it to the finish line.\r\n\r\nWhoever gets all four tokens to the end first is the winner. However, each move can only be made based on the number decided by casting a six-sided die, and each token can only move out of their home by casting a six. Additionally, the competition factor of the games is upped by the fact that while moving if another player’s token lands on the same square as your token, then your token will automatically be sent back home and you’ll need to roll a six again.\r\n\r\nLudo King is a game that was played by kings and now it can be enjoyed by you and your family and friends. While the game play might seem simple at first, the game is immensely enjoyable and challenging. You’ll be playing this one for hours and its fun for the whole family. Try to beat your opponents and compete for the highest scores on the leaderboards.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH58QD4","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Survivors: The Quest","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8457.13510798886905875.f0979f22-e1ad-477a-8282-8ebd05bdb864.828018f8-d9ed-4068-8c94-ed1f8bfc1db6","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58920.13510798886905875.3405c710-57a8-491c-b8de-ce1bb9d28700.59025dd4-f54b-42fc-9d67-b027b311418d","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47319.13510798886905875.ee3ea1ff-84fd-4a4c-88d9-062182e15fe5.a8839d14-0c30-49c4-8ae4-253796c5b445","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19541.13510798886905875.67b77e49-ba28-4fac-a9f4-bc493c5f1c60.f39ebdd0-12c2-4433-9aa5-f624d91903a3","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2923.13510798886905875.5a52b57f-273d-4493-93c1-b58fa975a866.d17237d9-7d0d-4a7c-98a5-b081e9010071","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44529.13510798886905875.9ea75237-ea6e-4ab4-ab99-e096b7b4c2d4.989e1502-e86e-4de5-a0b5-ea5a52a32533","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1778.13510798886905875.c774c592-fe72-4818-8ea0-81b1135821e9.99e1b8bd-e0e1-4f17-b052-ba15b82ef725","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9150.13510798886905875.c531bf1b-d613-45f2-b0b0-8013d6ac8011.0b275bfa-e300-410b-b502-e3a276f9d4c2","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14516.13510798886905875.07d59be9-c248-4a5a-ae19-0b42364a8108.9658e2f2-b90a-4138-b42c-a3c1c081cd00","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54959.13510798886905875.924e6a63-86b7-4640-9fcc-374c31b1defa.97b3121e-6d10-4cbc-8dd2-d1547794dda9","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"2","PackageFamilyNames":["828B5831.SurvivorstheQuest_ytsefhwckbdv6"],"ContentIds":["b6f86d1a-d062-5b14-cb7f-f10a130f2952","03383660-a3fa-f5e6-dc1d-e2ea35bdfd31","24707859-4b6d-4d51-d7ba-c1d5ee63407e"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Can you survive long enough to discover the island’s secrets?\r\n\r\nCraft tools, explore ruins, and gather important resources to help keep your team alive.
