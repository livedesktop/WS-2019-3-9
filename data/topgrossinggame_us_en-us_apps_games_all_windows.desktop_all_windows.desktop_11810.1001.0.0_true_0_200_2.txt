Destruction has never felt so real as you see doors and other car parts smash of your car. \r\n\r\nSome game-play tips:\r\nHave fun smashing and destroying your adversaries, but understand that the game is a quite accurate simulation of the real thing! In this derby simulator limiting car damage is key to becoming victorious and how you smash into other cars makes a big difference. Always try to smash rivals in the side of their vehicle or from the rear. Head-on collisions on the other hand should be avoided. Practice makes perfect!\r\n\r\nUpgrades:\r\nYou have various cars you can unlock. These all have the pros and cons. Be sure to upgrade your cars wisely as the various type of events require different cars. Use armor upgrades to strengthen your endurance; or engine upgrades to boost your speed. To get your upgrades you earn money during races. The better you perform the more you earn. Before a race you can also buy power-ups to boost your performance during a race. The nitro boost will allow you to accelerate super-fast and smash your opponents even harder; or choose one of the other power-ups such an armor booster to strengthen your car during the race.

Beautiful flowers make them feel the joys of spring, and the painting process turns into an enthralling game where they can bring their fantasies to life and draw a red daffodil, or a blue sunflower.\n\nPaint by numbers - an interactive coloring book for children. This mathematical game teaches children to recognize numbers and solve simple mathematical examples. In addition, this program develops memory, attention, imagination, and logical abilities.\nBoys and girls of all ages love to color. The simple coloring mode is suitable for the smallest of children, including those of kindergarten and preschool age. These include simple and recognizable images that are easy to color. If the child selects the wrong shape, then they will be prompted with the correct number. Therefore, the picture will always be colored correctly, and the child will quickly memorize the numbers. Children can choose to color by geometrical figures and pictograms in addition to numbers. A child can easily distinguish a square from a circle, diamond, and triangle.\nSchool-age children will enjoy the complex coloring mode. Here the picture is divided into a large number of elements, thus making it difficult at first to determine what it depicts. Older children can complicate the task by adding addition and subtraction tasks. Now children will need to solve the examples and choose the correct answers in order to color the picture. This will teach the child how to quickly do arithmetic in their mind.\nThose who are learning the alphabet can choose to color by letter. Coloring by letters will be useful for children preparing to enter primary school.\nTo make the coloring process more interesting and fun, you can change any of the preset colors. To do this, press and hold the jar of paint and a palette will open. Then you can choose your favorite color. Thus, all the shaded areas of the image can be changed in the coloring by number mode. You can have fun by changing the color scheme to suit your taste.

An assisted driving system allows everyone to learn even the most extreme stunts and thanks to the three play modes, anyone can experience the thrill of a real aerobatic pilot according to their abilities. Do you think you are really an expert? Compete with the simulation mode and push your reflexes to the maximum!\r\n\r\nOFFICIAL and SPECIAL MANEUVERS\r\nDiscover all the secrets of aerobatics with 3D briefing, take complete control and activate the aircraft with the right timing on the rudder, landing gear and smoke deployment! Take off, fly and run all opening maneuvers with the C-130 “Fat Albert”, either \"PARADE PASS\" or \"ASSAULT LANDING,\" with no limits, and you just have to give it your best. Now you can sit in the cockpit as a soloist and perform an \"AILERON ROLL\" to familiarize yourself with your own F/A-18 to then use all your adrenaline in increasingly challenging and complex maneuvers up to formation flying: the \"DIAMOND ROLL,\" \"DELTA BREAK-OUT,\" and \"FLEUR DE LIS\" are just a few examples of all the possible shapes that you will be called upon to perform by covering all roles of the true Blue Angels pilots.\r\n\r\nAIRSHOW\r\nPlan your exhibition by composing real aerobatics with faithfully reproduced official scenarios: NAF El Centro, NAS Key West, Reno, Elmendorf AFB and Baltimore. Your ultimate goal is to complete all airshows! You can do this by executing the real maneuvers in sequence or randomly. You have the freedom of choice. For every maneuver, you decide what role to play: the #1 FLIGHT LEADER, one of the wings, the #2 RIGHT WING and #3 LEFT WING, the #4 SLOT or one of the soloists, the #5 LEAD and #6 OPPOSING SOLO. \r\n\r\nADDITIVE MODE\r\nCreate aerobatic figures with additive mode! Freely position the planes in the scenario you've chosen and decide whether to make them take off. You can start with a standard flight or  high altitude and then take control of each aircraft in sequence. Aim nose up, make a loop, light the smoke, fly as you like, and when you're satisfied, the session for the first plane ends and the second aircraft takes off.

This thrilling mystery merges elements of classical horror and gritty, 50’s-style noir. \r\n\r\nA paranormal private investigator is contacted by her friend, famous reporter Helen Hunter, whose voice sounds small and terrified in the voicemail. She is in the coastal town of Serpent Creek, and needs help immediately.  \r\n\r\nBut upon arriving in Serpent Creek, the detective finds no trace of Ms. Hunter. And the manager of the nearby hotel, in which she supposedly stayed, claims to have never even seen her.\r\n\r\nWeirder still is the fact the town’s streets are crawling with snakes, and the citizens seem to be sleepwalking through life. The ground shakes with violent tremors.\r\n\r\nThis case will certainly challenge the protagonist’s skills as a detective. She must save her friend, reveal the corruption and hidden agendas of the town’s citizens, and, most importantly, stop an evil plot to bring the Snake God back to our world.\r\n\r\nWhen investigating Serpent Creek, the detective will perform true investigative work: finding clues and combining them to learn the secrets of every crime scene in the all new Detective Mode!

A drift is when a driver performs a controlled slide through corners while adhering to the racing line. Drifting involves fast cars, super skilled drivers and hardcore fans. \r\n\r\nIt’s a combination of driving skill, style and showmanship. It’s all about loss of the rear wheel traction while keeping the race car in total control. Drifting is so popular because it brings all the best aspects of motor sports into one package. \r\n____________________________________\r\n\r\n•Available in the following languages: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Chinese\r\n\r\nSUPPORT: http://driftmania2.com  \r\nVISIT US: http://ratrodstudio.com   \r\nFOLLOW US: twitter.com/ratrodstudio","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDQZMQ","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Bridge Constructor","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.60433.9007199266539091.8ef264e8-4011-4fa0-b077-1f539d6303b7.ff000e1f-60cd-494b-bc9e-3c6070b00dce","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.2182.9007199266539091.4d112bf8-461b-4a47-9acc-ff7257d7b852.b8a69d04-d50d-4187-9a1c-868f7eaf449c","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.38299.9007199266539091.0d2d9f99-f2a5-4bdb-8f8a-6e9ebd7d2e64.a0220571-dac8-4474-9b3a-8b2906328024","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.20312.9007199266539091.22aa676b-8328-4fb2-8fe8-25d753301b19.c40094f4-b035-43f2-9036-d2f58c8cce1d","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"$2.99⁺","Price":2.99,"AverageRating":4.4,"RatingsCount":"453","PackageFamilyNames":["HeadupGamesGmbHCo.KG.BridgeConstructor_zjj3tfjabet3j"],"ContentIds":["a30a5bdc-14f1-976f-58b8-09e89f9011ec","411c150c-ba81-9ef3-c416-c5e9e4e5be11"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"In Bridge Constructor you have to prove yourself as an accomplished master bridge builder.

Pure energy entities can travel freely between the two realms.\r\n\r\nThe story of WENJIA thus unfolds…\r\n\r\nA forest’s longstanding tranquility is shattered by a sudden earthquake. As lava bursts forth from the ground, the mountain’s spirits find themselves surrounded by fiery death. By controlling a kitten, the player must overcome numerous obstacles in the wild to reach the burning heart of the mountain and rescue the spirits before it’s too late.\r\n\r\nCross-Realm Travels\r\n\r\nWENJIA is a 2D platform game with puzzle-solving elements.
