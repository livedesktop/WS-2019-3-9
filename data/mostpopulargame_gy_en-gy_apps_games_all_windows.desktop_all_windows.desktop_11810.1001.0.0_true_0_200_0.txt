10!\r\n\r\nSolitaire remains the most played computer game of all time, and for good reason. Simple rules and straightforward gameplay make it easy to pick up for everyone.\r\n\r\nSolitaire has been part of Windows for more than 25 years, and the Microsoft Solitaire Collection makes it the best experience to date with five different card games in one:\r\n\r\nKlondike\r\nThis version is the timeless classic that many people just call \"Solitaire.\" Try to clear all the cards from the table using one or three-card draw, while using traditional scoring or the Vegas scoring system.\r\n\r\nSpider\r\nEight columns of cards await your attempts to clear them with the fewest moves possible. Start out playing with a single suit until you’re comfortable, and then see how you fare when using two or even all four suits in a game.\r\n\r\nFreeCell\r\nUse four extra cells to move cards around as you try to clear all cards from the table. More strategic than the Klondike version, FreeCell rewards players who think several moves ahead.\r\n\r\nTriPeaks\r\nSelect cards in a sequence, either up or down, to earn points and clear the board. How many boards can you clear before you run out of deals?\r\n\r\nPyramid\r\nPair two cards that add up to 13 in order to remove them from the board. Try to reach the top of the pyramid. See how many boards you can clear and how high you can score in this highly addictive card game!\r\n\r\nDaily Challenges\r\nPlayers receive new challenges each day. Complete enough Daily Challenges in a month to earn badges and compete with your friends.\r\n\r\nStar Club\r\nEven more challenges arranged in collections and packs you can unlock by earning stars.\r\n\r\nChoose Your Theme\r\nThe Microsoft Solitaire Collection features several beautiful themes, from the simplicity of \"Classic\" to the serenity of an Aquarium that comes to life before you while you play. You can even create custom themes from your own photos!\r\n\r\nXbox Live Integration\r\nSign in with your Microsoft account to earn achievements, compete with your friends on the leaderboards, and track your personal gameplay statistics. If you sign in with a Microsoft account, your progress is stored in the cloud so you can play the game on any device without missing a beat!\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PL3B0VQLQQ8","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Candy Crush Friends Saga","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60331.14250631626878947.a1e4a06f-a436-4205-90bb-cf45238965a4.b2d561ac-9d58-476a-ae2f-63a3196ee5d9","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55599.14250631626878947.a1e4a06f-a436-4205-90bb-cf45238965a4.cecd20f7-a10e-4db1-ba0c-554cfd67c470","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64684.14250631626878947.a1e4a06f-a436-4205-90bb-cf45238965a4.bb035610-778b-4ddd-917a-0c42becaf51c","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55751.14250631626878947.947bbf72-b5de-4577-8063-5493baf07813.738c1493-be23-4200-ac7a-fc0b798df9a9","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50174.14250631626878947.947bbf72-b5de-4577-8063-5493baf07813.8cae501b-f50c-459c-809c-feee37f74e58","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60831.14250631626878947.947bbf72-b5de-4577-8063-5493baf07813.f98990d1-c081-4d0b-8169-978114924f0e","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41806.14250631626878947.c4821a6c-ffe4-4245-a982-e7a1fdd219e4.c49de039-331e-42fb-85d1-9aee870d8511","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["king.com.CandyCrushFriends_kgqvnymyfvs32"],"ContentIds":["0c2af5d5-aa6f-3771-2c2f-524a3c1c4f57","d05cdeb5-7f8b-8f92-e9c3-d8dd8757ae4f"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"The newest game from the Candy Crush Franchise!

Recall your childhood!\r\n\r\nLudo game that traces its lineage to 6th century India. Ludo is derived from game Pachisi. Ludo is also very similar to Spanish board game.\r\n\r\nLudo game has stayed popular throughout the ages, varying only a little in its game structure. This persevering game is now available for you to play in an all new modernized format, i.e. as a video game application.\r\n\r\nThe game is played between 2 to 4 players and you have the option of playing the game against the computer, against your friends, or even against people from around the world. The objective of the game is pretty straightforward; each player gets 4 tokens, these tokens must make a full turn of the board and then make it to the finish line.\r\n\r\nWhoever gets all four tokens to the end first is the winner. However, each move can only be made based on the number decided by casting a six-sided die, and each token can only move out of their home by casting a six. Additionally, the competition factor of the games is upped by the fact that while moving if another player’s token lands on the same square as your token, then your token will automatically be sent back home and you’ll need to roll a six again.\r\n\r\nLudo King is a game that was played by kings and now it can be enjoyed by you and your family and friends. While the game play might seem simple at first, the game is immensely enjoyable and challenging. You’ll be playing this one for hours and its fun for the whole family. Try to beat your opponents and compete for the highest scores on the leaderboards.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH18846","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Candy Crush Saga","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.44511.13510798882606697.327db134-6bc2-4f76-9a46-0720bb116b70.865c659c-b0c8-4048-8933-7bd1c60464e2","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#0a8ad3","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37233.13510798882606697.9e54a75c-7720-4cee-92a9-832f20d97b88.f04b26a3-fcc5-4b32-a590-942dc9d67971","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#0a8ad3","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.32665.13510798882606697.dd942049-0097-4757-8870-c89cd0e91409.5557eb1a-0a96-4489-ba41-9c2c8439d0df","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#0a8ad3","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60967.13510798882606697.f8b7bd99-b7d5-4fb5-be6e-c18ee6b6e8ed.9dcde191-935a-4f35-96ce-84e29a91651d","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#0a8ad3","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.22774.13510798882606697.80fe3068-e6f2-44c0-b8d2-5fac9e6efafc.aae68f6c-8d47-400c-9cc3-aa8ce3cdac58","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#0a8ad3","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53732.13510798882606697.e5d371c5-27c1-41a6-ac36-22211ef20dab.caa96e8a-ffdd-454a-8036-4896f6278fce","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#0a8ad3","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.63064.13510798882606697.11aad4ea-fc6e-4a5c-b8aa-06443dbe3d7c.06d4119f-e44c-4430-bfe8-ac849c6eb761","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#0a8ad3","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54354.13510798882606697.7a42c472-75d7-487e-9538-ebb5ce1657e6.372723d8-dd1a-450a-9fed-d420e7705e4e","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.6,"RatingsCount":"49","PackageFamilyNames":["king.com.CandyCrushSaga_kgqvnymyfvs32"],"ContentIds":["86fd8ab2-940b-dba1-ba34-7a3dad8b9b98","7a2f3c0a-5b57-d9e6-a895-54511dc38991","c0f09d0c-0ce1-2f8e-32c6-12d59b287391","e309d18b-71de-964c-b152-c82b96c2f88f"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Candy Crush Saga, from the makers of Candy Crush Soda Saga & Farm Heroes Saga!\r\n\r\nJoin Tiffi and Mr. Toffee on their sweet adventure through the Candy Kingdom.

However, each move can only be made based on the number decided by casting a six-sided die, and each token can only move out of their home by casting a six. Additionally, the competition factor of the games is upped by the fact that while moving if another player’s token lands on the same square as your token, then your token will automatically be sent back home and you’ll need to roll a six again.\r\n\r\nPlay LUDO KING, Ludo with Friends NOW for FREE!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJ126","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Ice Age Adventures","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.62543.9007199266243729.47bd0961-c856-4283-8c9c-c645b3d73145.ee319041-0b52-46d5-8dd0-7eccad13a50c","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25921.9007199266243729.078e36b9-2945-414a-a6a2-753e03c66b65.464893b2-535e-47cd-ac49-4bb974473b81","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4126.9007199266243729.295a1892-f026-4ed4-bcee-92755315d2de.031920b7-4d38-4057-af41-d67ed785c41c","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55246.9007199266243729.5065564a-e236-42b5-9d08-0c0164583917.f7bd628e-0afc-4969-bf07-196fb5d64415","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.8,"RatingsCount":"4","PackageFamilyNames":["A278AB0D.IceAgeAdventures_h6adky7gbf63m"],"ContentIds":["2da1503d-1888-c727-53ab-5c0b124cd375","4b27d069-15b2-2b7d-cf59-b8fbf0061c6f"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Scrat's nutty pursuit of the cursed acorn has world-changing consequences.  \r\nManny, Diego, and the rest of the herd are suddenly at the edge of a continent that's cracking wide open!

The 28 domino tiles are shuffled face down and form the stock or boneyard. Each player draws seven tiles; the remainder are not used. Once the players begin drawing tiles, they are typically placed on-edge before the players, so that each player can see his own domino tiles, but none can see the value of other players' tiles. Every player can thus see how many tiles remain in the other players' hands at all times during gameplay. One player begins by downing (playing the first tile) one of their tiles. In different games first tiles are also different. In Muggins player should start with the highest double (6-6), in Bergen the first move should be 0-0, in Mexican train each round starts with the next lower double. This tile starts the line of play, a series of tiles in which adjacent tiles touch with matching, i.e. equal, values. The players alternately extend the line of play with one tile at one of its two ends. The game ends when one player wins by playing their last tile, or when the game is blocked because neither player can play. If that occurs, whoever caused the block gets all of the remaining player points not counting their own.\r\n- Scoring game\r\nPlayers accrue points during game play for certain configurations, moves, or emptying one's hand. Most scoring games use variations of the draw game. In Muggins (All fives) player must make the open ends of the layout add up to 5s or a multiple of five (5s, 10, 15, 20, etc.) In bergen player scores when numbers on the open ends are equal. If a player does not call \"domino\" before the tile is laid on the table, and another player says 'domino' after the tile is laid, the first player must pick up an extra domino. In Mexican train the double zero domino is scored as 50 points.\r\n- Draw game\r\nIn a draw game (blocking or scoring), players are additionally allowed to draw as many tiles as desired from the stock before playing a tile. The score of a game is the number of pips in the losing player's hand plus the number of pips in the stock. Most rules prescribe that two tiles need to remain in the stock.

It’s the most popular ever happening games in many countries. \r\n\r\nLudo (from Latin ludo, \"I play\") is a strategy board game in which the players race their four tokens from start to finish according to rolls of a single die. \r\n\r\nLudo is derived from the Indian game Parchisi, but simpler. The game and its variants are popular in many countries and under various names.\r\n\r\nParchisi originated in India by the 6th century. \r\n\r\nEach player rolls the die; the highest roller begins the game. Players alternate turns in a clockwise direction.\r\n\r\nLudo can be played by two, three, or four, without partnerships. To enter a token into play from its yard to its starting square, a player must roll a 6. If the player has no tokens yet in play and rolls other than a 6, the turn passes to the next player. Once a player has one or more tokens in play, he selects a token and moves it forwards along the track the number of squares indicated by the dice. Players must always move a token according to the die value rolled.
