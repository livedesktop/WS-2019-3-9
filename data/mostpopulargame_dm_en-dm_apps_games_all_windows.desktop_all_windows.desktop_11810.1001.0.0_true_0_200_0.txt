10!\r\n\r\nSolitaire remains the most played computer game of all time, and for good reason. Simple rules and straightforward gameplay make it easy to pick up for everyone.\r\n\r\nSolitaire has been part of Windows for more than 25 years, and the Microsoft Solitaire Collection makes it the best experience to date with five different card games in one:\r\n\r\nKlondike\r\nThis version is the timeless classic that many people just call \"Solitaire.\" Try to clear all the cards from the table using one or three-card draw, while using traditional scoring or the Vegas scoring system.\r\n\r\nSpider\r\nEight columns of cards await your attempts to clear them with the fewest moves possible. Start out playing with a single suit until you’re comfortable, and then see how you fare when using two or even all four suits in a game.\r\n\r\nFreeCell\r\nUse four extra cells to move cards around as you try to clear all cards from the table. More strategic than the Klondike version, FreeCell rewards players who think several moves ahead.\r\n\r\nTriPeaks\r\nSelect cards in a sequence, either up or down, to earn points and clear the board. How many boards can you clear before you run out of deals?\r\n\r\nPyramid\r\nPair two cards that add up to 13 in order to remove them from the board. Try to reach the top of the pyramid. See how many boards you can clear and how high you can score in this highly addictive card game!\r\n\r\nDaily Challenges\r\nPlayers receive new challenges each day. Complete enough Daily Challenges in a month to earn badges and compete with your friends.\r\n\r\nStar Club\r\nEven more challenges arranged in collections and packs you can unlock by earning stars.\r\n\r\nChoose Your Theme\r\nThe Microsoft Solitaire Collection features several beautiful themes, from the simplicity of \"Classic\" to the serenity of an Aquarium that comes to life before you while you play. You can even create custom themes from your own photos!\r\n\r\nXbox Live Integration\r\nSign in with your Microsoft account to earn achievements, compete with your friends on the leaderboards, and track your personal gameplay statistics. If you sign in with a Microsoft account, your progress is stored in the cloud so you can play the game on any device without missing a beat!\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9P8CP1L72JXS","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Forza Horizon 4 Demo","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61587.14094456225993959.9e5ac5ea-d493-41b8-a022-670c07221819.92a1da05-9721-4ca1-af08-88d9589276e5","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#222222","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55774.14094456225993959.e0ab1c7e-3cbc-4a85-88fe-055b1da9d5ed.df2bb18e-6339-4125-b1b7-293bcc7794e8","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#222222","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26248.14094456225993959.3f6d443e-5853-4818-9f5d-1cfe9f6a4a23.ca3debbe-fc5e-4064-a2c2-18b3d0c6fa31","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#222222","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.20615.14094456225993959.2d017079-463a-4bd6-ac7a-2fb4f65673e9.0faeefd3-4ad9-4634-98df-75b9aeb92d48","Height":2160,"Width":1440,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10662.14094456225993959.2d017079-463a-4bd6-ac7a-2fb4f65673e9.768c590f-b7d8-4184-adf0-f33f858943ac","Height":2160,"Width":2160,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["Microsoft.ForzaHorizon4Demo_8wekyb3d8bbwe"],"ContentIds":["f1571251-b4b3-51ac-e089-5a22044e1161","2053e330-a6f2-46b9-8f24-03867cee62a3"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Xbox One","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Dynamic seasons change everything at the world’s greatest automotive festival.

Recall your childhood!\r\n\r\nLudo game that traces its lineage to 6th century India. Ludo is derived from game Pachisi. Ludo is also very similar to Spanish board game.\r\n\r\nLudo game has stayed popular throughout the ages, varying only a little in its game structure. This persevering game is now available for you to play in an all new modernized format, i.e. as a video game application.\r\n\r\nThe game is played between 2 to 4 players and you have the option of playing the game against the computer, against your friends, or even against people from around the world. The objective of the game is pretty straightforward; each player gets 4 tokens, these tokens must make a full turn of the board and then make it to the finish line.\r\n\r\nWhoever gets all four tokens to the end first is the winner. However, each move can only be made based on the number decided by casting a six-sided die, and each token can only move out of their home by casting a six. Additionally, the competition factor of the games is upped by the fact that while moving if another player’s token lands on the same square as your token, then your token will automatically be sent back home and you’ll need to roll a six again.\r\n\r\nLudo King is a game that was played by kings and now it can be enjoyed by you and your family and friends. While the game play might seem simple at first, the game is immensely enjoyable and challenging. You’ll be playing this one for hours and its fun for the whole family. Try to beat your opponents and compete for the highest scores on the leaderboards.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH6H0WQ","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Police Bus Offroad Driver - Hill Climb Transport","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9848.13510798886708527.306bc61e-e2dd-4a85-988d-ef6a5c29d361.97b4cab5-be2f-41e2-b9aa-2b23a5b604f9","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.46258.13510798886708527.83ebbb49-216e-422c-89ba-c539bacd8ed1.49222121-51ea-48db-9487-6d343f8f592f","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47061.13510798886708527.13575c27-3838-4f82-a843-b72e879d5acf.d60d8572-11fa-46e5-bd97-c2c8141e9944","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["14859AppStreamStudios.PoliceBusOffroadDriver-CopsW_ykgtwtztg31z8"],"ContentIds":["f9b34818-2a35-d722-5242-33b2a4e54728","ceead865-b9e1-2efd-0400-5643c1713959"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Duty Cops are ready to fight against crime.

Each stack must start with an Ace, followed by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen and end with a King.\r\n✓ At the beginning of the game, all the cards are dealt into 8 columns. At the top of the screen you will find 4 free cells and 4 foundations. Use the free cells to temporarily store one card at a time during the game.\r\n✓ Once you place a card in the foundation you cannot take it back. Make sure you no longer need it before placing it there.\r\n✓ You can move a card from one column to another if the top card from the other column is +1 higher and is of a different color. For example, you can put a 3 of hearts over a 4 of spades. Or you can put a 10 of clubs over a Jack of diamonds.\r\n✓ You can move an entire series of cards if you have enough free positions. Empty columns and empty free cells are considered free positions. The series of cards must be smaller or equal than the number of free positions plus 1. For example, if you have 2 empty free cells and one empty column you can move at most 4 cards at a time.\r\n✓ If you cannot move a stack because it is too large you can try splitting it into two parts. Then you can reassemble it in a new column.\r\n\r\n\r\n★ Support and Feedback\r\nIf you have any technical problems, please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

Apparently AI is suddenly all the rage however the 2019 edition celebrates 16 years of ZingMagic bringing you the best in AI based board, card and puzzle games. So, yep we mastered AI along time ago!\r\n\r\nRegardless of your playing level, ZingMagic's multi award winning Chess is a fun, stimulating and challenging game for beginners and champions alike.\r\n\r\nChess is a two player game with a colourful history which can be traced back to its Indian ancestor, Chaturanga. In 1291 the Archbishop of Canterbury in England threatened clergy who continued playing Chess with a diet of bread and water.  \r\nThe game has flourished over the years and is now one of the most popular board games in the world, requiring thought, skill and strategy to become successful.\r\n\r\nThe object of Chess is to capture the opponent's King.  To capture the King you must place it in check.  If the King cannot escape by itself, or with the help of its army, it is in checkmate and the King is captured.\r\n \r\nZingMagic’s multi award winning Chess application supports over 20 levels of play allowing you to play moves or games against the clock or relax and play at your own pace. Whatever level of Chess you choose, you can be sure that ZingMagic’s Chess will give you a fun, stimulating and challenging game.\r\n\r\nThis game is ad-funded.
