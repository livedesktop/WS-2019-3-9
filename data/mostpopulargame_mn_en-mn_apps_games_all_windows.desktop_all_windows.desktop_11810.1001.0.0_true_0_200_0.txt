10!\r\n\r\nSolitaire remains the most played computer game of all time, and for good reason. Simple rules and straightforward gameplay make it easy to pick up for everyone.\r\n\r\nSolitaire has been part of Windows for more than 25 years, and the Microsoft Solitaire Collection makes it the best experience to date with five different card games in one:\r\n\r\nKlondike\r\nThis version is the timeless classic that many people just call \"Solitaire.\" Try to clear all the cards from the table using one or three-card draw, while using traditional scoring or the Vegas scoring system.\r\n\r\nSpider\r\nEight columns of cards await your attempts to clear them with the fewest moves possible. Start out playing with a single suit until you’re comfortable, and then see how you fare when using two or even all four suits in a game.\r\n\r\nFreeCell\r\nUse four extra cells to move cards around as you try to clear all cards from the table. More strategic than the Klondike version, FreeCell rewards players who think several moves ahead.\r\n\r\nTriPeaks\r\nSelect cards in a sequence, either up or down, to earn points and clear the board. How many boards can you clear before you run out of deals?\r\n\r\nPyramid\r\nPair two cards that add up to 13 in order to remove them from the board. Try to reach the top of the pyramid. See how many boards you can clear and how high you can score in this highly addictive card game!\r\n\r\nDaily Challenges\r\nPlayers receive new challenges each day. Complete enough Daily Challenges in a month to earn badges and compete with your friends.\r\n\r\nStar Club\r\nEven more challenges arranged in collections and packs you can unlock by earning stars.\r\n\r\nChoose Your Theme\r\nThe Microsoft Solitaire Collection features several beautiful themes, from the simplicity of \"Classic\" to the serenity of an Aquarium that comes to life before you while you play. You can even create custom themes from your own photos!\r\n\r\nXbox Live Integration\r\nSign in with your Microsoft account to earn achievements, compete with your friends on the leaderboards, and track your personal gameplay statistics. If you sign in with a Microsoft account, your progress is stored in the cloud so you can play the game on any device without missing a beat!\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

For the once that are wondering what kind of game is Zuma, here is little explanation. You will see many colorful balls in the game and the scope of the game is actually very simple - you must join 3 balls with same color on the chain and destroy them. So it sounds very easy and yes, it is but not that easy because it asks for some strategic thinking in order to complete this task.\r\n\r\nAlso you get a chance to choose your playing mode. When you are still a beginner, choose the 'easy mode' but as you become more skilled, the 'hard mode' would be your bigger challenge.\r\n\r\nThe game consists of three levels, three different worlds that hide their own challenges. The first world is 'Amazon jungle', the second one is 'Ancient Ruins' while the third one takes you to the \"Frozen Land\". You start joining the balls and if you don't manage to pass the level, you get a chance to play the level once again. Actually if you are not satisfied by our score in general, you could play again each level you want. Now let's see how is this going in praxis.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9MT23KFCDF5W","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Block Puzzle - Wood Legend","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4676.13821246868328114.606d4caf-0e20-441c-b6a7-2536a922b5eb.28496991-dbb1-48a4-bc93-47ae440ecf52","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.11297.13821246868328114.606d4caf-0e20-441c-b6a7-2536a922b5eb.dc73ddc8-5159-4e56-9afc-5b8ee6802ab9","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["61957Casualgame.ClassicWoodBlockPuzzle_0nt7ynh0rqkt4"],"ContentIds":["bac914dc-967e-0aad-dbd3-cfeaa8e34f7d"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Block Puzzle - Wood Legend is a addictive and classic puzzle game!\r\n\r\nChallenge yourself and play the best mind game with building blocks.
