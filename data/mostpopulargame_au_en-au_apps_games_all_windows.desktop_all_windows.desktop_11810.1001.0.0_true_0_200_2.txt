You wish you did not have to go outside, but you do. It would be easier to give up. But you don’t. The hardship, the hunger, the thirst. The fear. You keep reminding yourself why you stay alive. Why you do this. Then you hear it. “Daddy you’re back.” You wife’s face lights up and you open a bag full of medical supplies. You need not tell her how you got them. You simply enjoy your small victory in this, the harshest of times. In the post-apocalyptic world, you must keep your family alive in your underground bunker in this deep strategy game from Unicube...\r\n\r\nSheltered is a post-apocalyptic disaster management game that gives a whole new meaning to the term “nuclear family”. Given a head-start over the billions lost in a nuclear holocaust, you must gather as many supplies as possible en route to the concrete underground shelter that will soon become your family home for the foreseeable dreary future.\r\n\r\nWith all hope lost, how will you cope in this bleak new world? How you handle the many moral choices you'll encounter on a daily basis could be the difference between your family surviving or dying. Combat claustrophobia, radiation and mental exhaustion as you cling desperately to life in the cramp, cold and scary underground shelter. You’ll have to leave the scant protection the shelter offers behind as you’re forced to venture outside into the dangerous desolate wasteland to scavenge for vital supplies which could ensure your

For those that want a puzzle that lasts more than a few minutes. And now an unlimited supply of automatically generated 9 x 9 Sudokus for when you want a quick puzzle.\r\n\r\nThe Samurai and Super Sudokus come in three levels of difficulty, none of them are trivial or easy.  These are Sudoku that will take a bit of time to solve.  And if you complete one you will have solved it.  There are no cheats or hints to allow you to carry on if you get stuck. The 9x9 Sudoku come in four levels of difficulty with the most difficult requiring slightly harder solving techniques than the larger puzzles.\r\n\r\nThere are aids to help with some of the legwork though, the Sudoku will auto fill and update pencil marks showing all of the possible numbers available in each square and you can highlight all squares that can hold a possible number allowing patterns to be seen.  But, there is nothing in the Sudoku to shortcut the mental process required to complete it.\r\n\r\nThe list of Sudoku now shows whether automatic pencil marks or number highlighting have been used and the best time for each Sudoku will reflect this, if you complete a Sudoku without using assistance this will be recorded as your best even if it was slower than a previous attempt where assistance was used.\r\n\r\nThe Sudoku auto save so you can have several on the go at any time.\r\n\r\nAlso for traditionalists or the masochistic you can email a Sudoku to your computer to be printed out and solved the hard way with no highlighting assistance using a pen and paper.\r\n\r\nBecause of the size of the Sudoku this app will work best on a PC, tablet  or large screen phone.  However, the grid can be zoomed so play on almost any device should be possible with a pit of patience.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH6H9K3","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Hearts Card Game!","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27640.13510798886722506.e42a8a5a-1ce4-45ef-9eeb-10f557b175db.eefdbe52-be76-4289-89dc-a2e29b457fe4","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"darkGreen","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63491.13510798886722506.b6a1bf28-e567-4ccd-b36e-804a34361755.6896cc1e-4ac4-41ab-84e0-bafd2a9f9885","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"darkGreen","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.20579.13510798886722506.6185e30e-0e23-4fc6-ad9c-8cab5763a4be.a9b242ba-604e-4523-9e81-1b6b965ca9b6","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"darkGreen","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39300.13510798886722506.f2982707-b79d-45af-9211-0a2ff535eba6.c95300e0-d70e-4183-b223-c6eabb2b7215","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"darkGreen","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27566.13510798886722506.d13dee54-3856-4a51-be00-23ae2bab3b29.d9f271ab-3279-4703-a225-178ec39fe679","Height":434,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"darkGreen","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38488.13510798886722506.73454f55-3623-4bc0-b049-17b35bd4239b.62ab365c-c004-499c-923d-db582b329562","Height":558,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"darkGreen","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36643.13510798886722506.3f859ac9-875b-4120-a5d0-39a4f23e5c79.df94acbe-72d5-4a2e-be93-26097c828690","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"darkGreen","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.16107.13510798886722506.e4f94762-75a4-4ebf-8837-33fcd42a8ab5.9c57cfd2-6951-4b4b-9c2e-16f591c307be","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"darkGreen","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37500.13510798886722506.252cd2a2-2d93-4ba4-9cc2-62b8e47589f0.58fae96a-e118-423b-8c43-290e69b19bdc","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"darkGreen","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["26658FreezingBlue.HeartsCardGame_8hjv03pg675xa"],"ContentIds":["993f9814-de78-e923-bc5b-d54c07a0ea32"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Hearts is a great family card game for kids to adults.\r\n\r\nIt's a trick taking game involving 4 players, where the object of the game is have the lowest score when one person gets more than 100 points.

Each of the foundation piles must start with an ace and end with a king.\r\n✓ The cards from the 7 columns can be placed in descending order by alternating between red (hearts and diamonds) and black (spades and clubs). For example, you can place a 5 of hearts on a 6 of spades. \r\n✓ You are allowed to move runs of cards between columns. A run is a set of cards with numbers in a descending order and alternating colors.\r\n✓ If you ever get empty columns you can place a king or any run starting with a king.\r\n✓ When you run out of useful moves you can continue by tapping on the deck at the top left of the screen. You will draw 1 card or 3 cards depending on the type of the game. If there are no more cards in the deck tap on its outline to draw more cards from the beginning.\r\n✓ You should try to expose more and more cards as quickly as possible. Important cards might be buried under other cards.\r\n\r\n\r\n★ Support and Feedback\r\nIf you have any technical problems, please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

This thrilling mystery merges elements of classical horror and gritty, 50’s-style noir. \r\n\r\nA paranormal private investigator is contacted by her friend, famous reporter Helen Hunter, whose voice sounds small and terrified in the voicemail. She is in the coastal town of Serpent Creek, and needs help immediately.  \r\n\r\nBut upon arriving in Serpent Creek, the detective finds no trace of Ms. Hunter. And the manager of the nearby hotel, in which she supposedly stayed, claims to have never even seen her.\r\n\r\nWeirder still is the fact the town’s streets are crawling with snakes, and the citizens seem to be sleepwalking through life. The ground shakes with violent tremors.\r\n\r\nThis case will certainly challenge the protagonist’s skills as a detective. She must save her friend, reveal the corruption and hidden agendas of the town’s citizens, and, most importantly, stop an evil plot to bring the Snake God back to our world.\r\n\r\nWhen investigating Serpent Creek, the detective will perform true investigative work: finding clues and combining them to learn the secrets of every crime scene in the all new Detective Mode! What’s more, she will crack codes, pick locks and solve clever puzzles along the way.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PJ9D5FNGVJ8","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Pixel Gun 3D: Pocket Crafting & Building","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57929.14215644095708839.ec5758a1-6d5f-4281-9585-1b173705c686.8374e6ed-e796-4de4-88b0-a68ab57c601c","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#ffffff","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53965.14215644095708839.ec5758a1-6d5f-4281-9585-1b173705c686.15b6c9b4-ff91-43df-88be-baae820a5226","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#ffffff","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57929.14215644095708839.ec5758a1-6d5f-4281-9585-1b173705c686.8374e6ed-e796-4de4-88b0-a68ab57c601c","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#ffffff","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.2,"RatingsCount":"57","PackageFamilyNames":["27182KingdomEntertainment.PixelGun3DPocketCrafting_cpmqwwcbvdks4"],"ContentIds":["0d79cd6e-9a55-6c17-8359-e4b341c2b15c"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Exploration, survival & creative mode moved to another level.

It changes due to the person's actions and affects his/her rights and liberties. Citizens with higher rating have more benefits, and zero rating means forced liquidation of the person.\r\n\r\nBecause of a technical error you have received a rating that was even below zero: -0.01. Theoretically, this is simply impossible, and now you \"do not exist\": electronic devices do not identify you, officials and public services refuse to deal with you because of a system error. Now you can't even buy food or pay for treatment.\r\n\r\nTrying to obtain justice is useless, and the only way out is to hack the government server where the rating base of citizens is stored and edit the data on it. It's very difficult because the server is controlled by a quantum computer, and huge processing power is needed to overcome the quantum encryption. Your home computer is definitely unable to do this, so you need something more powerful.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n\r\n- Expand and develop a network of computers, decide when it is powerful enough to crack the quantum server;\r\n- Use the power of your network to mine cryptocurrency, earning funds for further upgrades and improvements;\r\n- Beware of the police and Cyber Control that can track down your suspicious activity and confiscate (or even burn) your equipment;\r\n- As the story goes, it becomes even more complicated: you thought that its only your own fate that depends on your actions, but it suddenly turns out that everything is more global...","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PNV3JQMWBW9","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Farm Frenzy 4","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28707.14341623208511892.1f14917f-d238-43aa-ab36-1027f6cc07a9.065997ff-ec93-4187-8fc5-7605481561cf","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.12994.14341623208511892.185156ef-f6c1-4c22-b3b2-94f2d8a049fd.74e744e3-83ab-4171-af94-45357fed6124","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"AU$10.45","Price":10.45,"AverageRating":3.0,"RatingsCount":"2","PackageFamilyNames":["09B6C2D8.186406364AD3C_hbbh9szp6erha"],"ContentIds":["7c83096f-263b-f024-1f84-41f0f795f46f"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Save grandpa and grandma's farm from foreclosure in the wacky and wonderful Farm Frenzy 4!

Players within a partnership face each other across a table. Traditionally, the players are referred to by the points of the compass - North, East, South and West.

This tactical top-down shooter puts you in the shoes of specialist Burton in his hunt for dangerous fugitives after a disastrous prison break.\r\n\r\nTACTICAL COMBAT\r\nUse the environment to your advantage. Avoid attacks by taking cover. Flank enemies for extra efficiency, but avoid getting flanked yourself! Use the tools of the trade to gain an edge - frag grenades, flash bangs, distractions, personal shields, proximity mines and more.\r\n\r\nSTEALTH\r\nChoose your approach with care. Some say running into the fray guns blazing isn’t always the best option. Use distractions to single out opponents. Use disguises and covers to sneak past irrelevant guards. Use silenced weapons to covertly reduce the enemy numbers.\r\n\r\nLOAD-OUTS & GEAR\r\nChoosing your load-out is a big part of your tactics. In addition to body armor and grenades you can carry one two-handed and one single-handed weapon in each mission - and there’s something for everyone. Shotguns, handguns, assault rifles, sniper rifles, crossbows, energy weapons, throwing axes and more.\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

on the face of the planet. These amazing animals boggle our imagination by their variety and size. Some were small like modern lizards, others as huge as a multi-storey building. Some were predators, for example the Tyrannosaurus Rex, Allosaurus, Velociraptor, Spinosaurus, while others were herbivorous - like the Diplodocus, Ankylosaurus and Iguanodon. Some species could fly, some lived in water, but most of them walked on the ancient land. Dinosaurs lived in the Mesozoic era, which is subdivided into three periods: Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous. Today, archaeologists study the remains of these animals and can only assume how they looked and lived.  \n\nPaint by numbers - an interactive coloring book for children. This mathematical game teaches children to recognize numbers and solve simple mathematical examples. In addition, this program develops memory, attention, imagination, and logical abilities.\nBoys and girls of all ages love to color. The simple coloring mode is suitable for the smallest of children, including those of kindergarten and preschool age. These include simple and recognizable images that are easy to color. If the child selects the wrong shape, then they will be prompted with the correct number. Therefore, the picture will always be colored correctly, and the child will quickly memorize the numbers. Children can choose to color by geometrical figures and pictograms in addition to numbers. A child can easily distinguish a square from a circle, diamond, and triangle.\nSchool-age children will enjoy the complex coloring mode. Here the picture is divided into a large number of elements, thus making it difficult at first to determine what it depicts. Older children can complicate the task by adding addition and subtraction tasks. Now children will need to solve the examples and choose the correct answers in order to color the picture. This will teach the child how to quickly do arithmetic in their mind.\nThose who are learning the alphabet can choose to color by letter. Coloring by letters will be useful for children preparing to enter primary school.\nTo make the coloring process more interesting and fun, you can change any of the preset colors. To do this, press and hold the jar of paint and a palette will open. Then you can choose your favorite color. Thus, all the shaded areas of the image can be changed in the coloring by number mode. You can have fun by changing the color scheme to suit your taste.

In this derby simulator limiting car damage is key to becoming victorious and how you smash into other cars makes a big difference.

To win you must avoid getting the scoring cards. Or you can Shoot the Moon. The game is over when one of the four players gains more or exactly 100 points. You win if you have the smallest score. Though chance is involved you can still make the best of your cards and win. Download and play now!\r\n\r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ FEATURES ★ ��� ★ \r\n\r\n✓ Advanced AI players \r\n✓ 3 Difficulty Levels\r\n✓ Balanced rules\r\n✓ Intuitive interface \r\n\r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ TIPS ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓ You can keep low and try to earn the lowest score by avoiding cards of hearts and especially by avoiding the 13-points Queen of ♠Spades. \r\n✓ Another strategy is to go big and take all the hearts and the Queen of ♠Spades, in which case you \"Shoot the Moon\". It will either take 26 points away or add 26 points to all your opponents. When at least one player goes over or reaches 100 points the game is over.\r\n✓ The scoring cards are the cards of hearts, each worth 1 point, and the Queen of ♠Spades, worth 13 points. Whoever plays the highest card of the suit that started the trick collects the trick. The value of the cards grows in this order 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King and Ace.\r\n✓ 13 cards are dealt to each player. Before every hand, each player has to choose 3 cards and pass them to another player with one exception. For every fourth hand no cards are passed. The player holding the 2♣ of clubs must lead to begin the first trick.\r\n✓ Players must follow suit. If you don't have a card of the suit which started the trick you can place any card.\r\n✓ Players can start tricks with a card from any suit, with one exception: the cards of hearts. Placing a card of hearts in the trick for the first time is called breaking the hearts. Once the hearts are broken you can start a trick with a card of hearts.\r\n✓ Sometimes you can collect all the scoring cards and thus you shoot the moon. In most cases you will receive 0 points and the others will each receive 26 points.\r\n✓ However, if by adding 26 points to other players they gain more than 100 points, but you still lose, another solution is preferred. In this case 26 points will be subtracted from your score and all the other players will keep their scores.\r\n✓ By default the set difficulty is easy. But you can change it from the main menu. To enter the main menu and to also pause the game just press on the button in the top left corner of the screen. You can change it from easy to medium, from medium to hard or from hard to easy. And the next time when you play a new hand, the AI will employ better strategies or not depending on your preferred difficulty level.\r\n\r\n\r\n★ Support and Feedback\r\n\r\nIf you have any technical problems, please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

One of the Microsoft developers noticed this version and implemented a version for Windows. It was first included with Win32s as an application that enabled the testing of the 32-bit thunking layer (does anyone remember what that was?). FreeCell remained relatively obscure until it was released as part of Windows 95. \r\nSince then the game has been ported to numerous platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We largely tried to recreate a full experience of the game in a tiny download package, including power moves, hints and undo (top right corner of the title bar). But there are also some minor twists to make it easier to play on a small factor mobile devices. In particular you don't have to select a card to move - drag and drop entire column - only appropriate cards will move, the rest will snap back. The cards will be moved to foundation automatically when possible. The scoring is also changed - only number of moves counted - the lower the score - the better. \r\n\r\nOnly the top (exposed) card of each tableau pile is available for play. It may be moved to a foundation pile, a free cell, or to another tableau pile. Within the tableau, cards are built down in sequence and alternating in color.
