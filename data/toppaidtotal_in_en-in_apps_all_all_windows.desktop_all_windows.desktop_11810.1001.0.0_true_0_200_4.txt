We've also released a brand new PC version of Chaos Control optimised for better desktop experience. You can find more info and download the new app on our website: http://chaos-control.mobi\r\n*******\r\n\r\nPeople don't usually achieve impressive results simply by being good at task management. It's the ability to set legitimate goals that makes the difference. Just write down your desired outcomes to make them real. This simple technique helps you to prioritize your goals before acting on them.\r\n\r\nChaos Control is a task manager based on the best ideas of GTD (Getting Things Done) methodology created by David Allen. Whether you are running a business, launching an app, working on a project or simply planning your holiday trip, Chaos Control is a perfect tool to manage your goals, juggle your priorities, and organize your tasks to get things done. And the best part is, you can handle both heavyweight project planning and simple daily routine like shopping list management in one flexible app. Also, Chaos Control is available across all major mobile and desktop platforms with seamless sync.\r\n\r\nHERE IS HOW IT WORKS:\r\n\r\n1) MANAGE YOUR PROJECTS\r\nProject is a goal combined with a set of tasks you need to complete in order to achieve it. Create as many projects as you like to write down all the desired outcomes you have\r\n\r\n2) ORGANIZE YOUR GOALS\r\nCreate unlimited number of projects and group them by category using Folders\r\n\r\n3) USE GTD CONTEXTS\r\nOrganize tasks from different projects using flexible context lists. If you are familiar with GTD you would just love this feature\r\n\r\n4) PLAN YOUR DAY\r\nSet due dates for tasks and make plans for any particular day\r\n\r\n5) USE CHAOS BOX\r\nPut all the incoming tasks, notes and ideas into Chaos Box in order to process them later. It works similar to GTD inbox, but you can use it as a simple to-do list\r\n\r\n6) SYNC YOUR DATA\r\nChaos Control works on both desktop and mobile devices. Setup an account and sync your projects across all of your devices\r\n\r\nThis app is designed with creative people in mind. Designers, writers, developers, startup founders, entrepreneurs of all kinds and pretty much anyone with ideas and desire to make them happen. We combined the power of GTD with the convenient interface to help you with:\r\n■ personal goal setting\r\n■ task management\r\n■ time management\r\n■ planning your business and personal activities\r\n■ building your routine\r\n■ handling simple to do lists, checklists and shopping lists\r\n■ catching your ideas and thoughts to process them later\r\n\r\nKEY FEATURES\r\n■ Seamless cloud sync across all major mobile and desktop platforms\r\n■ GTD-inspired Projects and Contexts supplemented with Folders, sub-folders and sub-contexts\r\n■ Recurring tasks (daily, weekly, monthly and chosen days of the week)\r\n■ Chaos Box - Inbox for your unstructured tasks, notes, memos, ideas and thoughts. Great tool for staying on track inspired by GTD ideas\r\n■ Notes for tasks, projects, folders and contexts\r\n■ Fast and smart search\r\n\r\nHave a productive day!","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDT0P5","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Coursera Viewer","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.23715.9007199266602164.d9dbe2a3-e23e-4899-8e3c-35abb7b434e1.3d043ebf-0010-452c-988d-23a27765efe9","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"₹ 79.00","Price":79.0,"AverageRating":2.3,"RatingsCount":"3","PackageFamilyNames":["47486AndrewsApp.CourseraViewer_1nyd86kgat6v4"],"ContentIds":["3cd89b2b-3fda-0b87-0143-5da43b140bc3"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"View Coursera video on your surface device anywhere.

A small dash of logic and you'll be able to solve any puzzle and there will be no limit to your exploratory spirit while interacting with the game's world: fire coconuts from a mammoth's trunk, turn into an animal or save the fair maiden from the Octo-Boss' grasp.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH6HQ14","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Autodesk Inventor 2016 Advanced Training","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8480.13510798886727653.fc334d2f-0833-4d2f-9486-015e2f7d65b4.a05c724d-c2b8-4671-af86-3c8f81833c16","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.12720.13510798886727653.33b0b8b2-cea2-4f34-8eaa-cf958f47b992.18d9abce-b42c-4c2f-8980-4c607f2847f0","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8480.13510798886727653.fc334d2f-0833-4d2f-9486-015e2f7d65b4.a05c724d-c2b8-4671-af86-3c8f81833c16","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"₹ 219.00","Price":219.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["18300TechMasterInc.AutodeskInventor2016AdvancedTra_4z1fv9yhtkj9t"],"ContentIds":["8bfbdaac-d261-849a-645e-8acb5401a719"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"In this Autodesk Inventor 2016 Advanced Training course, TechMaster will teach you how to create sketch, parts, assembly and drawing file using the variety of tools in Autodesk Inventor.

- Use Loci to Link In Your Mind. See https://iform.us. Loci is a method of loci mixed reality mind mapping application located in a virtual reality memory palace. It combines the method of loci memory technique and 3D mixed reality interaction with mind maps (graphs) to support you on your personal analysis tasks. These tasks can include looking for an apartment, finding out more about a disease, or deciding on a next job.  Features initial import capability using \"Load Graph\" voice command for MindManager, Freemind, and GraphML format files.\r\n\r\nWhy - Loci uses three core concepts to help you organize, understand and remember; mind maps let you break a problem down into component parts to organize and do analysis, mixed reality interaction with mind maps lets you visualize in 3D to understand how they are related, and the method of loci persistent placement of mind map nodes lets you improve your recall of the mind map, even when you are not using the Loci software.  In this way you can organize your problem, understand it, and remember it later when you need to use that information for decisions.\r\n\r\nHow - Loci is built for the Microsoft Mixed Reality. Loci supports spatial mapping so you can place nodes from your mind maps in relevant locations in your memory palace. Loci uses voice, gaze and gestures to enable you to make your 3D graphs (mind maps). You start by saying \"add node\" to make a node representing the problem you are working on, then you look at this node and again say \"add node\" to add more nodes for attributes of the problem, so you have a visualization of your problem. You can say \"load image\" to add nodes with images from files. You can link nodes together to show how they are related to each other. To load and save mind maps you use File Explorer or OneDrive. To help you understand how Loci works, it has a seven day free trial.\r\n\r\nWhere - Where you place and do things is very important to your memory.  Locations in your memory palace are important to you. They have meaning that you effectively recall, and with Loci you can combine your visual and spatial memory.\r\n\r\nWhen - Loci helps you on longer term problems you are working on, where you need to apply your capabilities for cognition.

However, certain entities in the Energy Realm have evolved into matter-less sentient beings. The game’s kitten protagonist (a cat-shaped energy entity) and spirits are all examples of such beings. Pure energy entities can travel freely between the two realms.\r\n\r\nThe story of WENJIA thus unfolds…\r\n\r\nA forest’s longstanding tranquility is shattered by a sudden earthquake. As lava bursts forth from the ground, the mountain’s spirits find themselves surrounded by fiery death. By controlling a kitten, the player must overcome numerous obstacles in the wild to reach the burning heart of the mountain and rescue the spirits before it’s too late.\r\n\r\nCross-Realm Travels\r\n\r\nWENJIA is a 2D platform game with puzzle-solving elements. Players can freely travel between two realms, each of them with different challenges and obstacles. Players must utilize both realms’ mechanisms to reach their final goal.\r\n\r\nSoothing In-game Environment\r\n\r\nWENJIA’s exquisite hand-drawn graphics bring out both the vivid colorfulness of the Matter Realm and the fantastical strangeness of the Energy Realm. The sharp contrast between the two realms offers the players a unique visual feast.\r\n\r\nWorking with game audio talents from Russia, WENJIA’s sound team has created an immersive fantasy environment that features deep woods, eerie ruins, and raging volcanos.\r\n\r\nSimple Gameplay\r\n\r\nWENJIA’s simplified gameplay makes it easy for everyone to enjoy the game.

The software can use all internal and external USB* webcams that are supported by Windows 8.1 and 10. Instant Photo Booth comes with 17 built-in photo layouts optimized for both single page and dual strip 4×6 photo booth products, which you can print on your own printer. \r\n\r\nUsers see a live preview with a countdown timer, and the selected photo layout fills in with each shot. After the photo session is complete, users can experiment with image styles, border colors, corners, and backgrounds. Each image can also have a small time stamp. At the end of the process, the user can print and/or share the final product. Instant Photo Booth supports the Windows 8.1 print and sharing charms, as well as direct integration with Facebook and SkyDrive.\r\n\r\nInstant Photo Booth is also highly customizable. Suppose you are going to set up a photo booth as part of a fundraising event, or for your wedding guests. Wouldn’t it be great to customize the look? What if you could also customize the products so they became souvenirs of your event? Or suppose your event has so many people that you need to keep the session time as short as possible. Instant Photo Booth has extensive customization features that will allow you to do all of these things, and more.\r\n\r\nOn top of all these things, Instant Photo Booth has several optional features that make it comparable to professional photo booth software such as green screen (chroma key), guest book, idle-time slide show, and multiple monitor support.\r\n\r\nThe free version is fully functional, but has image watermarks.\r\n\r\n*USB webcams are not supported by Windows RT.","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDMF4R","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Cat Games","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.4395.9007199266441644.f0522215-cb28-4c63-869d-ff5486878f02.6aa888d3-2d77-4c07-b90a-c0e07a540427","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#208700","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"₹ 79.00","Price":79.0,"AverageRating":3.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["59181AGuyNamedJon.CatGames_zg7xkyfa0eh12"],"ContentIds":["087edd77-b191-220f-c163-9ba3ca6f80d0"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Finally, an app that your cat can enjoy.

With KeyPenX you can also assign PowerPoint controlling actions - go to the next slide when you click pen button once, previous slide  when you double click and start slideshow, when you press and hold the button. Essentially, KeyPenX turns your Surface Pen into PowerPoint remote control!\r\n\r\nUnlike default fixed PowerPoint shortcuts for Surface Pen in Windows 10, with KeyPenX you can fully customize presentation navigation shortcuts, including starting slideshow.\r\n\r\nIf you are an active Surface Pen user, especially if you are a teacher or a presenter frequently using PowerPoint and handwriting notes on your slides, it is extremely convenient way of advancing presentations using Surface Pen only.\r\n\r\nWhat is unique about KeyPenX? It is also possible to assign secondary actions when PowerPoint is not running. After presenting you don’t have to go back to your Surface system settings and change pen shortcuts to their default behavior. \r\n\r\nEven if you don't use PowerPoint for presentations, with KeyPenX you can control Google Slides in Google Chrome or Firefox browser, Adobe Acrobat DC, Acrobat Reader DC, VLC Player, OpenOffice or LibreOffice Impress.\r\n\r\nKeyPenX has embedded actions for recording short audio clips and taking snapshots from camera.\r\n\r\nHow it works:\r\n\r\n- During the first launch KeyPenX makes a new sub-folder \"KeyPenX\" in your \"Documents\" folder and generates three shortcuts \"KeyPenX-SingleClick.lnk\", \"KeyPenX-DoubleClick.lnk\" and \"KeyPenX-PressHold.lnk\".\r\n\r\n- Follow instructions in KeyPenX main window and assign those file shortcuts to pen shortcuts in Windows system settings \"Pen settings\".\r\n\r\n- Define in KeyPenX secondary actions for situation when PowerPoint is not running - start OneNote, Cortana, Windows Ink Workspace, record short audio clip, take a snapshot from Surface camera or directly execute any classic app.\r\n\r\nPlease note: KeyPenX cannot define pen actions for execution under the lock screen.","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9N0C3XVGXTC6","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Vermillion Watch: Moorgate Accord","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25158.13928335158417683.8130071d-f12d-4126-a3e7-0a68009cbb0e.357fee16-7edb-40c3-8643-9efd3c6ba6d3","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35609.13928335158417683.8130071d-f12d-4126-a3e7-0a68009cbb0e.0c455cc7-9d94-4852-aaf7-da19858c680d","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24765.13928335158417683.fa2d57eb-0de9-48d3-b8b1-04a79a55fa27.fdae625f-e25e-4751-be73-dc7677084d98","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58372.13928335158417683.fa2d57eb-0de9-48d3-b8b1-04a79a55fa27.522930ff-6a60-4120-88a8-0b8dd063c235","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"₹ 549.00","Price":549.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["BigFishGames.VermillionWatchMoorgateAccord_bsrvrvej7yy2w"],"ContentIds":["01c12085-927d-1c02-53c9-e70bb20f967a"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"What starts as an ordinary meeting with your uncle and his friend quickly takes a dark turn when a massive creature of unknown origin attacks!

In 1291 the Archbishop of Canterbury in England threatened clergy who continued playing Chess with a diet of bread and water.  \r\nThe game has flourished over the years and is now one of the most popular board games in the world, requiring thought, skill and strategy to become successful.\r\n\r\nThe object of Chess is to capture the opponent's King.  To capture the King you must place it in check.  If the King cannot escape by itself, or with the help of its army, it is in checkmate and the King is captured.\r\n \r\nZingMagic’s multi award winning Chess application supports over 20 levels of play allowing you to play moves or games against the clock or relax and play at your own pace.

turn-based battles!\r\n\r\nOne year ago, the world of Asdivine was enveloped by a brilliant flash of light. Since that time, the influence of shadow has only continued to grow ever more powerful across the face of the land. Although the event itself was undoubtedly connected with the heavens, few people seem to have realized the far-reaching implications of what transpired. Now turning to the present, a surprising revelation awaits a young man, Zack, and his childhood friend, Stella, in the capital from a chubby cat claiming to be none other than the Light Deity and declaring the world to be on the verge of destruction...\r\n\r\nAsdivine Hearts boasts of plenty of subquests, a battle arena, treasure to dig for, and an enemy guide to complete. By setting puzzle piece-like jewels in a box known as a rubix, players are able to customize characters!
