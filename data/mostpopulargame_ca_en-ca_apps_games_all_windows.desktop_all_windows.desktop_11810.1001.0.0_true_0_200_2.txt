It is fundamentally different from most solitaire games in that very few hands are unsolvable. Although software implementations vary, most versions label the hands with a number (derived from the random number seed used to generate the hand).\r\n\r\nA version of FreeCell was created by Microsoft for release with the Windows operating system.\r\n\r\nFreeCell solitaire is one kinds of funny solitaire card game, but it's not like other solitaires. You need no luck to win, only skill is required. All cards are opened from the start and the deal has the solution, you can win, think and move wisely. \r\n\r\nKey Features: \r\n- deals with different difficulty \r\n- every completed deal has score \r\n- customizable background and card \r\n- magnetic card movement \r\n- supermove: multiple card dragging \r\n- drag or tap to move \r\n- undo option \r\n- optimized battery usage for very long gameplay \r\n\r\nRules\r\nConstruction and layout\r\nOne standard 52-card deck is used.\r\nThere are four open cells and four open foundations. Some alternate rules use between one to ten cells.\r\nCards are dealt into eight cascades, four of which comprise seven cards and four of which comprise six. Some alternate rules will use between four to ten cascades.\r\n\r\nBuilding during play\r\nThe top card of each cascade begins a tableau.\r\nTableaux must be built down by alternating colors.\r\nFoundations are built up by suit.\r\n\r\nMoves\r\nAny cell card or top card of any cascade may be moved to build on a tableau, or moved to an empty cell, an empty cascade, or its foundation.\r\nComplete or partial tableaus may be moved to build on existing tableaus, or moved to empty cascades, by recursively placing and removing cards through intermediate locations. Computer implementations often show this motion, but players using physical decks typically move the tableau at once.\r\n\r\nVictory\r\nThe game is won after all cards are moved to their foundation piles.\r\nVarious computer versions of Freecell occasionally deal unsolvable games.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nOne of the oldest ancestors of FreeCell is Eight Off. In the June 1968 edition of Scientific American, Martin Gardner described in his \"Mathematical Games\" column a game by C. L. Baker that is similar to FreeCell, except that cards on the tableau are built by suit rather than by alternate colors. Gardner wrote, \"The game was taught to Baker by his father, who in turn learned it from an Englishman during the 1920s.\" This variant is now called Baker's Game. FreeCell's origins may date back even further to 1945 and a Scandinavian game called Napoleon in St. Helena (not the game Napoleon at St. Helena, also known as Forty Thieves).\r\n\r\nPaul Alfille changed Baker's Game by making cards build according to alternate colors, thus creating FreeCell. He implemented the first computerised version of it in the TUTOR programming language for the PLATO educational computer system in 1978. Alfille was able to display easily recognizable graphical images of playing cards on the 512 * 512 monochrome display on the PLATO systems.\r\n\r\nThis original FreeCell environment allowed games with 4–10 columns and 1–10 cells in addition to the standard 8 * 4 game. For each variant, the program stored a ranked list of the players with the longest winning streaks. There was also a tournament system that allowed people to compete to win difficult hand-picked deals. Paul Alfille describes this early FreeCell environment in more detail in an interview from 2000.\r\n\r\n\r\nSolver complexity\r\nThe FreeCell game has a constant number of cards. This implies that in constant time, a person or computer could list all of the possible moves from a given start configuration and discover a winning set of moves or, assuming the game cannot be solved, the lack thereof. To perform an interesting complexity analysis one must construct a generalized version of the FreeCell game with 4 * n cards. This generalized version of the game is NP-complete; it is unlikely that any algorithm more efficient than a brute-force search exists that can find solutions for arbitrary generalized FreeCell configurations.\r\n\r\nThere are 52! (i.e., 52 factorial), or approximately 8*1067, distinct deals. However, some games are effectively identical to others because suits assigned to cards are arbitrary or columns can be swapped. After taking these factors into account, there are approximately 1.75*1064 distinct games.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH3ZHNZ","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Taptiles Windows 10","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.62032.13510798887944702.b2ee2de2-7299-4b59-98be-4b78a7c9d59d.9a1d3f44-37da-419c-8416-4807bd15e8fc","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18336.13510798887944702.0c682363-7485-4316-977c-f9771632a43d.c78950db-bd79-4b91-b00d-8373a39502c1","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41146.13510798887944702.2c905179-6d42-476a-9289-b118a102cf84.b291d66f-d470-4593-882b-8b9262623a81","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.4,"RatingsCount":"196","PackageFamilyNames":["ArkadiumLabs.Taptiles2_0wzk3fg68w9ze"],"ContentIds":["1312d2de-78b7-c9de-41bb-570e28637758","a4b80803-b989-522f-4553-252a20ad94d8"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Find pairs of tiles to complete puzzles in this exciting matching game with a unique twist!

You create a new astronaut, gain levels and experience for every move you make by completing missions in space. You will have access to missions similar to what happened in real life, or fictional missions designed to challenge you as an astronaut.\r\n\r\nSpacecrafts are highly complicated machines with the primary task of exploring and understanding what's outside the atmosphere of Earth, while keeping the astronauts alive for long periods. This is achieved by hundreds of individual systems and backup systems working together. With the help from the in-game Space Flight Academy, the provided flight manual for each spacecraft, and checklists, you will learn how to fly and operate these machines, and explore space in a high resolution and realistic environment.\r\n\r\nControl almost every system like the real astronauts, see the sunset and sunrise while orbiting orbiting Earth with speeds exceeding 25,500 ft/s. Explore the surface of Earth and the Moon with high resolution textures, or simply enjoy the solitude of being in space.\r\n\r\nImagine the final few seconds before launching into space. You are sitting on top of a 111 meter high rocket, looking at the instruments of a spaceship about to leave the oasis we call Earth. The engines are igniting, mechanical systems are clinging below you, while thousands of gallons of fuel is pumping through the systems. The loud roar of the five F1 engines are producing close to 8,000,000 pounds of thrust, violently shaking the cockpit and lifting 3 million kg off the pad. The launch pad tower is slowly moving away from you while the engines are balancing the rocket like a skyscraper on a needle. Sophisticated engineers has created the systems that will safely accelerate you to 25,500 ft/s, into a free fall orbit, with the Moon as the destination.\r\n\r\nWelcome to Reentry, an orbital simulator.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH338DR","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Rummy 500!","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35551.13510798885015984.0ce579a9-ce84-420b-b76f-8f666be2b913.29ce63d2-182e-4cd5-9bee-b3b2d90e8edc","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5123.13510798885015984.ded3d1bc-d54c-4c71-b40e-de8897284bf2.3f1a21cb-a6aa-41b8-8938-a5dbe1214784","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.62650.13510798885015984.e4e0e391-44e7-4d4a-8700-6cbd13f6d1d5.55440215-83bd-4fb4-a543-3a397471758d","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45230.13510798885015984.0cb3abe8-1edb-4591-bc3c-ed1fba00e4f7.6360537d-69ec-4e42-b2ca-d60fc61a5256","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52875.13510798885015984.99533582-d97a-41dc-b91e-b58b23ddb174.e7b713cc-ad83-4495-8a41-f227cacc78db","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57547.13510798885015984.4ebc7f58-0850-44ac-8b1b-f32c2e680fb6.248311b9-1414-47a7-9bc8-81005cf66daf","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38237.13510798885015984.d266efd1-72dd-4c96-ae42-dcae8fe69a71.f0c0b5ad-44c8-49d5-8e18-b3275b642bd7","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55149.13510798885015984.3e1b4e36-8149-40a3-87d5-89d58a5d18f2.1026316b-7011-4ff3-9e98-df43ed509a70","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53906.13510798885015984.a1e0666c-fcf8-4773-9708-a358000cdc8f.400f031d-e6d0-4d79-b670-d776d25a32be","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61976.13510798885015984.4cb197d1-546c-4f26-8602-4ef6a0ae2fb4.1ca632f1-b803-41af-bced-e38bb7d1d34e","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.4,"RatingsCount":"60","PackageFamilyNames":["TrivialTechnology.UltimateRummy500_0ynvawc60ma20"],"ContentIds":["01831087-a441-f5d7-0109-c5940a762685","0f94574c-eb97-344d-ff3a-89a0ebd3a91e"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Challenge yourself with Rummy 500, the classic card game!\r\n\r\nNow with a brand new Online Multiplayer mode!

He must play either the next card in sequential order or a wild '*' card, using either cards in hand, the top card of his stock pile, or the top card of any of his four discard piles. If the player can play all five cards from hand, he draws five more and continues playing. When no more plays are available, the player discards one card to either an empty discard pile or on top of an existing one and play passes to the next player. When a build pile reaches 12, it is removed from the board and that space becomes empty for another pile to be started; play continues until one player has played his final start card.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH3G194","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Hidden Words 365","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.43909.13510798884251281.6885c32f-a39b-431e-85a2-1bce7a0b8d46.4a1c2071-5560-40cd-8e3c-ee83ac878b18","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#22287D","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34277.13510798884251281.0b6d4b15-c628-4d92-a78e-9b2861b6e3a6.2d1ea0c3-c4dc-4e00-a3d8-4b384398a766","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#22287D","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.45335.13510798884251281.78c8aa71-942c-4d7a-8d50-c55b9b6133e3.ad5e715c-e35b-40f2-8c63-efa779569261","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#22287D","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.4,"RatingsCount":"194","PackageFamilyNames":["37936Larocque.HiddenWords365_kgerrer9nxtm4"],"ContentIds":["3c404626-00ae-4fe7-7f38-417a6b9014ac"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Hidden Words 365 is a fun and addictive word puzzle game in which you will have to find all the words in a grid.

The goal of the game is to take as many tricks as possible and reach a score of 10 or more first. The game is played in pairs. Your partner sits opposite to you and the deals are played clockwise. Each player is dealt five cards and the game starts by choosing a card suit.\r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ FEATURES ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓ advanced AI players\r\n✓ intuitive interface\r\n✓ balanced rules\r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ TIPS ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓\tIn the first round you can choose the trump suit by choosing the card from the center pile. \r\n✓\tIf the current round passes without choosing the trump a second one follows.\r\n✓\tIn the second round you must choose any suit of cards except the one you passed in the round before.\r\n✓\tIf the trump is not chosen in these 2 rounds the cards are reshuffled and the game starts again without changing the dealer.\r\n✓\tOnce a trump suit is chosen the game can start. \r\n✓\tIf you choose a trump suit in the first round, the card in the center pile is passed to the dealer of the cards.\r\n✓\tIf you are the dealer of the cards, your name is marked with an encircled D. If the trump is chosen in the first round you receive the trump card and must shed any card you wish.\r\n✓\tThe player next to the dealer in a clock-wise direction is the first to choose a trump suit. \r\n✓\tIf that player passes the chance, the next one after him follows.\r\n✓\tThe game is played between two teams: a top-bottom team comprised of you and a computer player and a left-right team of computer players.\r\n✓\tThe player and his partner are called the makers if one of them chooses a trump suit. Otherwise they are called the defenders.\r\n✓\tTo win the makers must take at least 3 tricks. The defenders in order to win must take at least 3 tricks as well.\r\n✓\tIf the makers take 5 tricks they score 2 points. If the defenders take 3 or more tricks they score 2 points.\r\n✓\tIf the makers take 3 or 4 tricks they score 1 point. If the makers take less than 3 tricks they score 0 points.\r\n✓\tThere is the possibility of playing alone by pressing the -play alone- button when choosing the trump.\r\n✓\tWhen playing alone the team scores 4 points if the maker takes all 5 tricks. Otherwise if the team takes 3 or 4 tricks it scores only 1 point.\r\n✓\tThere is a specific order of the trump cards. The trump Jack is the most valuable card, followed by the Jack of the same-color suit. \r\n✓\tFor example if the trump suit is hearts, the most valuable card is the Jack of hearts followed by the Jack of diamonds.\r\n✓\tThese cards are followed by the Ace, the King, the Queen, the 10 and the 9. \r\n✓\tThere are only 24 cards in the deck - 6 from each suit.\r\n✓\tThe order of the cards in the other suits is the Ace, the King, the Queen, the Jack, the 10 and the 9.\r\n✓\tThe Jack of the same color as the trump suit makes part of the trump suit.\r\n✓\tYou can start the trick with any card but you must follow suit or play any other card if you cannot follow suit.\r\n✓\tThe trick is won by the player who plays the highest trump or the highest card of the starting suit.\r\n✓\tTo win the game you must be the first to score 10 or more points.\r\n✓\tThere is a statistics menu in which you can view the total games played, the percentage of won games, the number of rounds played, the number of euchres made.\r\n✓\tIf you as a defender take 3 or more tricks then you achieve a euchre.\r\n✓\tIf you as a maker take less than 3 tricks then you have been euchred.\r\n✓\tThe makers are marked with an M. The player that chose the trump is marked with a bold M.\r\n✓\tThe defenders are marked with a D.\r\n\r\n★ Support and Feedback\r\nIf you have any technical problems please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

In this derby simulator limiting car damage is key to becoming victorious and how you smash into other cars makes a big difference. Always try to smash rivals in the side of their vehicle or from the rear. Head-on collisions on the other hand should be avoided. Practice makes perfect!\r\n\r\nUpgrades:\r\nYou have various cars you can unlock. These all have the pros and cons. Be sure to upgrade your cars wisely as the various type of events require different cars. Use armor upgrades to strengthen your endurance; or engine upgrades to boost your speed. To get your upgrades you earn money during races. The better you perform the more you earn. Before a race you can also buy power-ups to boost your performance during a race. The nitro boost will allow you to accelerate super-fast and smash your opponents even harder; or choose one of the other power-ups such an armor booster to strengthen your car during the race. \r\n\r\nIf you like demolition games this game is made for you!\r\n3, 2, 1 start your download and join the ultimate demolition derby game experience now!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9N35Z6LNJ8G4","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Mysterious Slot Machine","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32046.13938365119934255.728735f8-0dc5-4ed4-ac34-352c32d15159.3680c3cf-f229-4c70-89c6-5f9b204a9b36","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#0078d7","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58613.13938365119934255.728735f8-0dc5-4ed4-ac34-352c32d15159.48804488-d2c0-4abf-95ff-3daccc6ee355","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"#0078d7","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58406.13938365119934255.728735f8-0dc5-4ed4-ac34-352c32d15159.0d440829-6b08-466f-a2ad-4dab7a2991da","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#0078d7","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30479.13938365119934255.728735f8-0dc5-4ed4-ac34-352c32d15159.42b28cb4-ea92-400c-bde6-2988544bd7f8","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#0078d7","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27129.13938365119934255.728735f8-0dc5-4ed4-ac34-352c32d15159.4a17ae7c-8267-4d0e-a846-eab3063e6002","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57598.13938365119934255.727cded8-d152-44c0-b42d-b34162d380a6.5dd0e3b4-d5f9-484d-aff8-db20be41ebaa","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.6,"RatingsCount":"16","PackageFamilyNames":["DukselSlotsGames.MysteriousSlotMachine_zm3qhcr9k9m08"],"ContentIds":["7a963b63-6090-4011-0dfe-be5d5d3438a5","6e244ba5-00db-24b6-e2fc-f092bcde793a"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Mysterious Casino Slots Game = Huge Payouts = Mega Bonus Games\r\n\r\nWelcome and Play popular Las Vegas Mysterious Casino Slot Machine.

cards. The computer game was originally created by Brodie Lockard in 1981 and named Mah-Jongg after the game that uses the same tiles for play. Lockard claims that it was based on a centuries-old Chinese game called \"the Turtle\". However, it was not until Activision released Shanghai in 1986 for the Macintosh and Apple IIgs that the game gathered momentum. A version of this game was also included in the Microsoft Entertainment Pack for Windows 3.x in 1990 and went by the name Taipei. It was subsequently included in the Best of Windows Entertainment Pack. Premium editions of the Windows Vista operating system and Windows 7 include a version of the game known as Mahjong Titans. \r\nAs any other successful game, millions of clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We tried to recreate all the fun of original game with 60 different layouts in a tiny download package. \r\nA tile that can be moved left or right without disturbing other tiles is said to be exposed. Exposed pairs of identical tiles (Flower and Seasons tiles in the same group being considered identical) are removed from the layout one at a time, gradually exposing the lower layers to play. The aim of the game is to clear the layout by pairing up all the tiles. The game is finished when either the layout is empty, or there are no exposed pairs remaining.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH67PLX","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"The Escapists: The Walking Dead","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63680.13510798886647859.ce648bcf-79fa-4040-99c5-b823e3d568d0.0bad56a2-33ec-4164-aecc-10e708d6c12b","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22593.13510798886647859.e58be451-6399-4067-8bf0-7294452855a4.9c8feb14-7ea8-4e25-88c5-d8651ee68aea","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48709.13510798886647859.fab9506f-da0a-4f10-abd0-3245c9835311.a182368a-ef72-4840-b64d-7c8c4ea56a75","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54756.13510798886647859.18e697d2-0513-4789-a640-58c388769a9b.dd9e2bcb-6f63-4baf-aa0c-9a33d3da6d7d","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44291.13510798886647859.d992dd60-81f9-4177-b21c-a991dd78f7fd.8f60b554-a5eb-4e86-9fc3-744ca76c0c26","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34651.13510798886647859.f7f334c8-5624-4b8a-b7ff-51ff21edd385.683c6338-21f8-4c82-990f-54a87a027456","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6741.13510798886647859.686965e4-eca9-47f6-b9bc-f444ad8ead6e.4b892136-48df-42ee-9fcf-1e12236760bd","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17771.13510798886647859.0dd09e2b-6cad-408d-8dcf-5106daf51538.da451dac-c9bc-44fe-bcae-589132859cfd","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26476.13510798886647859.6402ac38-2c74-46e0-852e-c697317f2d1a.3542a05f-fd29-4eae-8e56-b6bd0e388db1","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48709.13510798886647859.fab9506f-da0a-4f10-abd0-3245c9835311.a182368a-ef72-4840-b64d-7c8c4ea56a75","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"CAD $25.99","Price":25.99,"AverageRating":3.3,"RatingsCount":"3","PackageFamilyNames":["Team17DigitalLimited.TheEscapistsTheWalkingDead_j5x4vj4y67jhc"],"ContentIds":["b7f9316f-ac2d-b271-a143-854507f461ac"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Merging the award-winning, smash-hit, indie game The Escapists with the worldwide phenomenon that is The Walking Dead, comes The Escapists: The Walking Dead.

Rick must secure the safety of the group by seeking out a safe escape route from each area, and manage several dangerous tasks to keep as many of the group alive as possible. The game faithfully matches the timeline of the comics, meaning Rick must first fight his way out of the Harrison Memorial Hospital, visit the Greene family farm before visiting destinations such as

And like a real model airplane, it will take some practice to master the basics. Luckily, in RC-AirSim, plane crashes are free (and fun)!\r\n\r\nQuestions? Comments? Suggestions?

The aim of the game is to get all of the cards in order (King to Ace). To win, you must remove all the cards from the table by building columns organized in descending order, from king to ace. At intermediate (2-suits) and advanced (4-suites) levels, the cards must also match suit. When you succeed in building a sequentially-ordered column, it flies off the table. If you run out of moves, click the pile at the bottom of the table to deal a new row of cards. \r\n\r\nIn our version we largely tried to recreate a full experience of that version in a tiny download package, along with multiple suite versions of the game, hints and undo (top right corner of the title bar). But there are also some minor twists to make it easier to play on a small factor mobile devices. In particular you don't have to select a card to move - drag and drop entire column - only appropriate cards will move, the rest will snap back. The scoring is also changed - only number of moves counted - the lower the score - the better.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH6J292","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Kingdom Tales 2 HD","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41772.13510798886734847.2c79ad1d-6d1c-42c5-b3df-d74d348b58ae.10d7118a-48aa-4bfc-aa0e-c4775d17ed10","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#1357AC","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59670.13510798886734847.2a95dd59-e033-432d-b474-3e27293d9bf5.dd37872e-d6d6-4539-95aa-e5c222d2e2a0","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#1357AC","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.2,"RatingsCount":"138","PackageFamilyNames":["828B5831.KingdomTales2HD_ytsefhwckbdv6"],"ContentIds":["80b69ad1-0bcf-2c21-5841-e596938116d4"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Help young Finn reunite with his beloved Princess Dahla in this exciting time management adventure! \r\nThe only daughter of the fair King Arnor, Dahla was known throughout the land – the rising sun was no match for her beauty, nor were all the druids a match for her cleverness.
