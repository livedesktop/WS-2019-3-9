10!\r\n\r\nSolitaire remains the most played computer game of all time, and for good reason. Simple rules and straightforward gameplay make it easy to pick up for everyone.\r\n\r\nSolitaire has been part of Windows for more than 25 years, and the Microsoft Solitaire Collection makes it the best experience to date with five different card games in one:\r\n\r\nKlondike\r\nThis version is the timeless classic that many people just call \"Solitaire.\" Try to clear all the cards from the table using one or three-card draw, while using traditional scoring or the Vegas scoring system.\r\n\r\nSpider\r\nEight columns of cards await your attempts to clear them with the fewest moves possible. Start out playing with a single suit until you’re comfortable, and then see how you fare when using two or even all four suits in a game.\r\n\r\nFreeCell\r\nUse four extra cells to move cards around as you try to clear all cards from the table. More strategic than the Klondike version, FreeCell rewards players who think several moves ahead.\r\n\r\nTriPeaks\r\nSelect cards in a sequence, either up or down, to earn points and clear the board. How many boards can you clear before you run out of deals?\r\n\r\nPyramid\r\nPair two cards that add up to 13 in order to remove them from the board. Try to reach the top of the pyramid. See how many boards you can clear and how high you can score in this highly addictive card game!\r\n\r\nDaily Challenges\r\nPlayers receive new challenges each day. Complete enough Daily Challenges in a month to earn badges and compete with your friends.\r\n\r\nStar Club\r\nEven more challenges arranged in collections and packs you can unlock by earning stars.\r\n\r\nChoose Your Theme\r\nThe Microsoft Solitaire Collection features several beautiful themes, from the simplicity of \"Classic\" to the serenity of an Aquarium that comes to life before you while you play. You can even create custom themes from your own photos!\r\n\r\nXbox Live Integration\r\nSign in with your Microsoft account to earn achievements, compete with your friends on the leaderboards, and track your personal gameplay statistics.

Build, expand, plan your strategy, the decision is in your hands!\r\nBut don’t stop there, recruit dozens of funny characters, add them to your collection and watch as they populate the streets and bring your city to life!\r\n\r\nBuild the BEST. CITY. EVER.\r\n- Craft hundreds of unique, gorgeous buildings in your city and expand it from a tiny, peaceful town to a big, bustling metropolis.\r\n- Don’t forget to decorate your skyline by building famous landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, the Tower of London or the Tower of Pisa (there’s something for every tower fan) to elevate your city to the top tourist destinations.\r\n\r\nMeet your new family \r\n- Cartoon fans rejoice! Meet and collect tons of funny characters with their own unique personalities, like the portly Sergeant Cakemore, or the uber-macho builder guy, Forest Manly (whose real skill is the tiny bit too suggestive eyebrow raise).\r\n- Build a water tower. Check! Build a fire station. Check! But who’s going to drive the fire truck? Assigning citizens to jobs will help you optimize your city, but you can go even further! Send them on missions and they won’t come home empty handed or do favors for them so they would invite their friends too to fill your city!\r\n\r\nFusion is the way to go\r\n- The future: age of smart forks, exploding hover boards, even selfies! But now the 21st century lives up to its promise, with the ability to merge buildings into advanced skyscrapers and unlock specializations.\r\n- Unlocking each allows you to develop your city towards different directions and expand your collection with specialized buildings such as Sustainability, Commerce, Education and Entertainment.

It is played on a square board, made of 64 smaller squares, with eight squares on each side. Each player starts with sixteen pieces: eight pawns, two knights, two bishops, two rooks, one queen and one king. The goal of the game is for each player to try and checkmate the king of the opponent. Checkmate is a threat ('check') to the opposing king which no move can stop. It ends the game.\r\nDuring the game the two opponents take turns to move one of their pieces to a different square of the board. One player ('White') has pieces of a light color; the other player ('Black') has pieces of a dark color. There are rules about how pieces move, and about taking the opponent's pieces off the board.

In this derby simulator limiting car damage is key to becoming victorious and how you smash into other cars makes a big difference.

The nitro boost will allow you to accelerate super-fast and smash your opponents even harder; or choose one of the other power-ups such an armor booster to strengthen your car during the race. \r\n\r\nIf you like demolition games this game is made for you!\r\n3, 2, 1 start your download and join the ultimate demolition derby game experience now!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH5KL3J","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"American Truck Simulator 2016","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15094.13510798887024381.0332654b-cf27-442a-8253-f7f8afaa0f63.483decbd-fba4-4a8c-b186-4f31d732ca33","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22085.13510798887024381.7a0ec03a-eb29-4935-94b4-d9a6688fadd3.ce9793b2-01ae-4d2c-bab3-73281132a57c","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7876.13510798887024381.97f82211-6469-49d1-bb32-e7240c2af0a0.ed84a51c-a19e-4b62-bc50-1402d1f12598","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["IronjawStudiosPrivateLimi.AmericanTruckSimulator20_0ah1jqwq7j8nj"],"ContentIds":["5cc41903-5d43-e91a-ea81-c365281dbea8","b6663999-f795-5c12-0273-fa557cee7cd8","bda90d39-9051-4d75-fb87-c12dda3fa83d"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Travel across a vast open dynamic island with breathtaking landscapes and beautiful landmarks with 40 trucks with Realistic physics simulation and dozens of exciting job quests to keep you on the edge of the driving seat.\r\nTest of endurance, driving skill and speed to keep you engaged with a soothing and relaxing driving experience is now for free to play.\r\n\r\nA Driving Experience packed with:\r\n•\tRealistic Truck Simulation\r\n•\t40 Unique Trucks to Drive\r\n•\tBreathtaking Landscape\r\n•\tBeautiful Landmarks\r\n•\tFull Open World Island to Explore\r\n•\tCustom Radio Station with 24x7 Country Music\r\n•\tExciting Job Quests\r\n•\tDay and Night Cycle ","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9P7S73MRSH9V","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Dead Rivals -

Are you ready to play?\r\n\r\n★A Villain's Untold Tale... ★\r\n\r\nThe world fits villains in a tidy box while praising the hero who plays a starring role in every tale, new and old. There is no regard to what may be a lie; a truth untold. The villain is always hated; the hero adored beyond all else. No one stops to consider what has brought the villain to these circumstances. Was he a victim himself? Perhaps his story has been twisted, written by the winner, the warrior all adore and root for. But you can never truly understand the villain until you look from behind the lens of the hero's vantage. His is a story that must be heard. Sometimes it's a truth we have to do bad things for good results, and when that happens, people often forget all the good beforehand. You haven't heard the full story until you learn monster's have nightmares too... and will do anything to ensure their reality never dawns.\r\n\r\nLEVEL ONE - Military Plane\r\nThis initial level is prepared with challenging game timers that begin an immediate countdown upon entering.
