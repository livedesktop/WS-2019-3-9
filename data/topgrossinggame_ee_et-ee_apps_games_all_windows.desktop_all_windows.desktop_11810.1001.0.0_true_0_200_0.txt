Astroneer is set during the 25th century Intergalactic Age of Discovery, where Astroneers explore the frontiers of outer space, risking their lives in harsh environments to unearth rare discoveries and unlock the mysteries of the universe.\r\n\r\nOn this adventure, players can work together to build custom bases above or below ground, create vehicles to explore a vast solar system, and use terrain to create anything they can imagine. A player’s creativity and ingenuity are the key to seeking out and thriving while on exciting planetary adventures! In Astroneer you can:\r\n\r\n•Reshape the ground under your feet as though it were made of clay.\r\n•Survive on and explore carefully crafted planets that can be entirely deformed and traversed.\r\n•Snap together components and objects to build bases and vehicles.\r\n•Play with friends in 4 player online drop-in/drop-out co-op.\r\n•Discover and uncover the mysteries of the solar system\r\n\r\n•••Deform & shape everything around you•••\r\nIn Astroneer, players use their deform tool to dig, collect, shape and build anything they wish. Use this ability to dig to the center of the planet, build a ramp into the sky, or make megaliths just by using terrain! \r\n\r\n•••Explore an entire solar system•••\r\nOur vast solar system includes 7 wondrous planets that players can travel between and explore every inch of, from the entire spherical surface, through treacherous layers of caves, all the way down to mysterious the core. Each of those planets has unique and challenging surface and cave biomes that offer a multitude of challenges for players on their journey.\r\n\r\n•••Customize & build on the fly••• \r\nItems that Astroneers craft and find in the world can be snapped and connected together to create unique creations for any situation. Customize and decorate your bases, vehicles, and Astroneer.\r\n\r\n•••4 Player co-op•••\r\nAstroneer is better with friends. Group up with other players and work together to create massive industrial bases or to create fun games in the extensive creative sandbox. \r\n\r\n•••Survive & harness the power of the planets•••\r\nOnce Astroneers are ready, they may choose to attempt to understand and possibly harness the power behind mysterious structures found in the world.\r\n\r\nAstroneer began as a Game Preview title and would not be here today if not for your support, feedback, and ideas throughout that process. Now that we have hit 1.0 we will keep our pledge to continue building on the foundation that is Astroneer with free, ongoing content updates.

blend of city building and tower defense awesomeness!\r\n\r\nUNIQUE SIMULATION + STRATEGY GAMING\r\nTake back the wilderness from the invading bloon hordes and pop your way from a modest settlement to a thriving metropolis. Attack bloon-infested territory adjacent to your city, win a short tower defense game, and add the captured territory to your city as a space on which to build. Buildings are the heart of your city, and each one has a specific purpose - individual monkey towers for battle, upgrades for those towers, farms and banks to drive your economy, power to supercharge your city, epic buildings for epic powers, and decorations to make your city more awesome. Every time you build, your city looks cooler, you increase your power potential in tower defense play, and you open up even more rewards and challenges.\r\n\r\nAMAZING DEPTH AND VARIETY\r\nAll 21 of the fully awesomized and carefully balanced Bloons TD 5 towers are available within Monkey City, with completely new unlock mechanics. More than 130 buildings and decorations give you endless strategies and city design options. Explore the wilderness to find treasure tiles and uncover 11 powerful special items like the Banana Replicator and the Dark Temple Idol. Burst bloons on 55 all new tower defense maps or test your mastery on 13 wildly challenging original special missions. Either way, be ready to encounter all new bloon waves and special bloon attack patterns like Cash Starve or Fast and Furious.\r\n\r\nREINFORCE YOUR FRIENDS\r\nConnect with Facebook friends, then help each other win and expand. Send Supply Crates back and forth for bonus starting cash. Visit friends' cities to check out their strategies and their city design skills, and while you're there root out any bloon spies to win a reward for both you and your friend.\r\n\r\nSHOW OFF YOUR SKILLS\r\nBuild up the strongest lineup of monkey towers possible and compete with other players for the best score in weekly Contested Territory events. Use the latest in monkey science to send player vs. player bloon attacks, then see whose defenses are the strongest and earn extra rewards for victory.\r\n\r\nDownload for free and play Bloons Monkey City now!\r\n\r\nPlease Note:\r\nBloons Monkey City is free to download and play (aside from internet, carrier, data, device, and other services for which the player is financially responsible), but some in-game items can be purchased with real money.

The 28 domino tiles are shuffled face down and form the stock or boneyard. Each player draws seven tiles; the remainder are not used. Once the players begin drawing tiles, they are typically placed on-edge before the players, so that each player can see his own domino tiles, but none can see the value of other players' tiles. Every player can thus see how many tiles remain in the other players' hands at all times during gameplay. One player begins by downing (playing the first tile) one of their tiles. In different games first tiles are also different. In Muggins player should start with the highest double (6-6), in Bergen the first move should be 0-0, in Mexican train each round starts with the next lower double. This tile starts the line of play, a series of tiles in which adjacent tiles touch with matching, i.e. equal, values. The players alternately extend the line of play with one tile at one of its two ends. The game ends when one player wins by playing their last tile, or when the game is blocked because neither player can play. If that occurs, whoever caused the block gets all of the remaining player points not counting their own.\r\n- Scoring game\r\nPlayers accrue points during game play for certain configurations, moves, or emptying one's hand. Most scoring games use variations of the draw game. In Muggins (All fives) player must make the open ends of the layout add up to 5s or a multiple of five (5s, 10, 15, 20, etc.) In bergen player scores when numbers on the open ends are equal. If a player does not call \"domino\" before the tile is laid on the table, and another player says 'domino' after the tile is laid, the first player must pick up an extra domino. In Mexican train the double zero domino is scored as 50 points.\r\n- Draw game\r\nIn a draw game (blocking or scoring), players are additionally allowed to draw as many tiles as desired from the stock before playing a tile. The score of a game is the number of pips in the losing player's hand plus the number of pips in the stock. Most rules prescribe that two tiles need to remain in the stock. The Draw game is often referred to as simply \"dominos\".\r\n\r\nIf you like board games like Checkers, Mahjong, Backgammon and Chess, you will love Dominoes: Best Classic Dominoes Board Game.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9MT5LSM6VQQS","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Pixel Knight Adventures","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1167.13814754316737363.aaecc0a8-4ac7-4e8b-b068-bf8976c791ec.aff7bf77-7cc4-415e-a8e7-650feae614e3","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39839.13814754316737363.de744fba-7c47-4822-b57b-d4fbb8f4217c.a9945045-b3e9-486a-99cb-ef53bb91cce8","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Tasuta⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":2.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["AMGames.PixelKnightAdventures_0et4xf6j5enw4"],"ContentIds":["cb79cdf2-7834-0324-cf9a-816e36311a1c","cb04c03a-74a6-5b97-7571-7a3499e9a379"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC-arvuti,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Pixel Knight – welcome to the Middle Ages!

Each stack must start with an Ace, followed by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen and end with a King.\r\n✓ At the beginning of the game, all the cards are dealt into 8 columns. At the top of the screen you will find 4 free cells and 4 foundations. Use the free cells to temporarily store one card at a time during the game.\r\n✓ Once you place a card in the foundation you cannot take it back. Make sure you no longer need it before placing it there.\r\n✓ You can move a card from one column to another if the top card from the other column is +1 higher and is of a different color. For example, you can put a 3 of hearts over a 4 of spades. Or you can put a 10 of clubs over a Jack of diamonds.\r\n✓ You can move an entire series of cards if you have enough free positions. Empty columns and empty free cells are considered free positions. The series of cards must be smaller or equal than the number of free positions plus 1. For example, if you have 2 empty free cells and one empty column you can move at most 4 cards at a time.\r\n✓ If you cannot move a stack because it is too large you can try splitting it into two parts. Then you can reassemble it in a new column.\r\n\r\n\r\n★ Support and Feedback\r\nIf you have any technical problems, please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

Dominate enemy territories and collect dynamic melee and firearm weapons. Navigate tricky obstacles throughout sprawling 3D pixel landscapes. This survival world is filled with great stimulated battlefields for a fun FPS experience. Are you ready to play?\r\n\r\n★A Villain's Untold Tale... ★\r\n\r\nThe world fits villains in a tidy box while praising the hero who plays a starring role in every tale, new and old. There is no regard to what may be a lie; a truth untold. The villain is always hated; the hero adored beyond all else. No one stops to consider what has brought the villain to these circumstances. Was he a victim himself? Perhaps his story has been twisted, written by the winner, the warrior all adore and root for. But you can never truly understand the villain until you look from behind the lens of the hero's vantage. His is a story that must be heard. Sometimes it's a truth we have to do bad things for good results, and when that happens, people often forget all the good beforehand. You haven't heard the full story until you learn monster's have nightmares too... and will do anything to ensure their reality never dawns.\r\n\r\nLEVEL ONE - Military Plane\r\nThis initial level is prepared with challenging game timers that begin an immediate countdown upon entering. It's a race against the clock as you defeat a given number of enemies before your time runs out. Collect perks and weapons, then run and shot your way to victory.\r\n\r\nLEVEL TWO - Midland\r\nThis battle arena is rife with enemies just waiting to see to your failure. Ammo and health are yours to claim throughout the level, but if you run short of needed supplies, brief video ads can be watched to achieve what you need. Foes are all around, so be every aware of your surroundings by making good use of your entity maps to spy oncoming opponents. \r\n\r\nLEVEL THREE - Prison\r\nIt's every man for himself in this fight to the finish.

It is a wonderful game for anyone who likes to try luck at guessing numbers. Keno is probably the simplest game in the casino. \r\n\r\nIt has taken the world by storm over the past several years.\r\n\r\nThe objective of Keno is as simple: its just bet and win!\r\n\r\nKeno is of Chinese origin and of great antiquity, dating back at least 2,000 years. The original \r\nChinese name for the game is baige piao or pai-ko p’iao, meaning “white dove ticket”, a reference to the tickets used in a betting game involving homing dove. \r\n\r\nThis simple game has come a long way since its humble beginnings and this has become a popular attraction at the casinos.\r\n\r\nKeno is part-lottery, part-bingo, with some unique rules of its own in the mix as well, and this creates a game experience like no other. \r\n\r\nThe rules are simple in which the players guess which numbers will be drawn at random and get paid based on how many numbers they guess correctly. Depending on how many numbers you choose, your odds of matching with the 20 balls drawn from the pot will change - and the prizes paid out change too. If you have never played Keno before the good news is that the rules are incredibly simple to learn.\r\n\r\nKeno game would initially look more at home in lottery centres but it is also a pretty popular casino game too.
