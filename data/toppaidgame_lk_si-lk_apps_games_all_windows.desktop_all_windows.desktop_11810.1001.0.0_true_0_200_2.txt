After your child uses Friendly Math a few times, the app will start choosing questions that gently challenge your child's ability without discouraging progress. The goal is to achieve that sweet spot where questions are not too easy and not too difficult to achieve maximum benefits.  \r\n \r\nMy motivation for developing Friendly Math grew out of watching my two children interact with various math apps over the years. I noticed that some apps were too harsh on the kids, using negative scoring which resulted in a lot of tears and frustration. Other apps were timed games offering multiple choice answers. My concern with those was that kids learned to quickly press the correct buttons without much understanding of the subject matter.\r\n\r\nFriendly Math was developed to address some of these concerns. With Friendly Math, children are not timed in order to allow them time to think, consolidate knowledge, and truly understand problems. Incorrect answers are not penalized and the app often offers second chances. I believe that this approach encourages the spirit of learning and experimentation. Positive reinforcement is used, not negative scoring. This prevents children from forming negative attitudes towards math and protects their self-esteem. The apps' simple visual design helps children focus on math with minimal distractions, so that learning can easily be transferred into school testing and real life scenarios. \r\n \r\nFriendly Math provides your child with rewards in the form of collectible achievements. For best effect, parents are encouraged to provide additional positive reinforcement by linking app achievements with additional rewards. You know best what works for your child, whether it is extra pocket money, screen time, taking them on a trip or nothing at all.  Each achievement is unlocked by answering 100 questions correctly, which can be done in a session or two. Ideally, your child should be encouraged to use the app a few times a week, so 3 or 4 achievements a week should be optimal. Again, a balance should be achieved here.  Too little use may not provide optimal benefits, but too much use may result in negative attitudes and fatigue. Again, you know best what is optimal for your child. \r\n \r\nFriendly Math can be used by up to five children providing they are sharing a computer. It is important that every child is playing under his or her \"login\" as the app tailors questions to your child. If they have dedicated devices, you will need a separate license for each child.  \r\n \r\nFriendly Math lets you install the app on multiple devices and the progress will follow your child as she changes devices. So, your child can start on one device and continue playing on another.  \r\n \r\nI have done my best to design Friendly Math for special accessibility requirements, but I have limited resources for testing this. If you find something is not working optimally in terms of accessibility, please email me so that I can improve it. I am really keen to get this right!\r\n \r\nIf you encounter any bugs or problems, just drop me an email. I can usually fix issues quickly. No call centers here, I will personally reply to your emails.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PF8L9P1ZSDN","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Bomber Man Bomb It","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40674.14209417072314947.63b14390-2b6e-4663-ab3f-158a585310f9.497ab1a0-fba1-49f7-b9ef-b25d034fc89c","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#333333","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5289.14209417072314947.63b14390-2b6e-4663-ab3f-158a585310f9.f4e64205-8f3f-4aaa-9f05-a15509c9a527","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#333333","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14334.14209417072314947.63b14390-2b6e-4663-ab3f-158a585310f9.236b5cb0-8c4c-4daa-8e8e-c2cdc73b2594","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#333333","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32243.14209417072314947.63b14390-2b6e-4663-ab3f-158a585310f9.9db8bfdf-4f13-4838-8ba2-adb4ba16bd87","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#333333","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$1.99","Price":1.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["46320GangJ.BomberManBombIt_3t4kszejwetv6"],"ContentIds":["0fd01456-736a-2030-2fe8-30af8a161c1c","63b12fdd-ed95-5f88-1154-d3930730bbe2"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Bomb It is an amazing Bomberman game that lets you battle out intense competitions by yourself or together with a friend. \r\n\r\nPlace your bombs strategically to blow up the enemies and destroy objects.

With huge excitement, boys and girls decorate the Christmas tree, make sweets, deck out the house and look forward to their presents. These coloring pages depict your favorite Christmas characters and the main symbols of the festive season. The coloring process gives every kid the feeling of the Christmas holidays drawing near.\r\n\r\nPaint by numbers - an interactive coloring book for children. This mathematical game teaches children to recognize numbers and solve simple mathematical examples. In addition, this program develops memory, attention, imagination, and logical abilities.\r\nBoys and girls of all ages love to color. The simple coloring mode is suitable for the smallest of children, including those of kindergarten and preschool age. These include simple and recognizable images that are easy to color. If the child selects the wrong shape, then they will be prompted with the correct number. Therefore, the picture will always be colored correctly, and the child will quickly memorize the numbers. Children can choose to color by geometrical figures and pictograms in addition to numbers. A child can easily distinguish a square from a circle, diamond, and triangle.\r\nSchool-age children will enjoy the complex coloring mode. Here the picture is divided into a large number of elements, thus making it difficult at first to determine what it depicts. Older children can complicate the task by adding addition and subtraction tasks. Now children will need to solve the examples and choose the correct answers in order to color the picture. This will teach the child how to quickly do arithmetic in their mind.\r\nThose who are learning the alphabet can choose to color by letter. Coloring by letters will be useful for children preparing to enter primary school.\r\nTo make the coloring process more interesting and fun, you can change any of the preset colors. To do this, press and hold the jar of paint and a palette will open. Then you can choose your favorite color. Thus, all the shaded areas of the image can be changed in the coloring by number mode. You can have fun by changing the color scheme to suit your taste.

Moreover, once you manage to reach the bottom level of the dungeon and slay Lord Slyn, you'll also have to fight your way and survive the road back to the surface.\r\n\r\nMultiple player classes with awesome abilities\r\n\r\nBefore starting your quest you will have to choose one of the five possible hero classes: fighter, mage, paladin, priest, and ranger.\r\n\r\nEach of these classes come with unique strengths and weaknesses that will require a different approach when confronting the enemies from the dungeon.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, as most rogulike games, death is final so advance carefully and engage in battles only when you're sure you can come out victorious or you'll have to start the adventure from the very beginning.\r\n\r\nBesides monsters, the dungeon is also the place where you will find lots of weapons, equipment and consumables with different properties. While some can give you an instant boost to your skills, other can be cursed and besides their negative effects will bind to your hero needing you to remove their curse if you want to get rid of them.\r\n\r\nSpell books, potions, and magic wands can also be found during your adventure but, will require identification scrolls if you don't want to risk casting a curse on yourself or drinking a deadly potion.\r\n\r\nThe game packs lots of content regarding weapons, equipment, and other consumables which combined with the random dungeon generator, makes it deliver a completely unique experience each time you play it.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

This mathematical game teaches children to recognize numbers and solve simple mathematical examples. In addition, this program develops memory, attention, imagination, and logical abilities.\nBoys and girls of all ages love to color. The simple coloring mode is suitable for the smallest of children, including those of kindergarten and preschool age. These include simple and recognizable images that are easy to color. If the child selects the wrong shape, then they will be prompted with the correct number. Therefore, the picture will always be colored correctly, and the child will quickly memorize the numbers. Children can choose to color by geometrical figures and pictograms in addition to numbers. A child can easily distinguish a square from a circle, diamond, and triangle.\nSchool-age children will enjoy the complex coloring mode. Here the picture is divided into a large number of elements, thus making it difficult at first to determine what it depicts. Older children can complicate the task by adding addition and subtraction tasks. Now children will need to solve the examples and choose the correct answers in order to color the picture. This will teach the child how to quickly do arithmetic in their mind.\nThose who are learning the alphabet can choose to color by letter. Coloring by letters will be useful for children preparing to enter primary school.\nTo make the coloring process more interesting and fun, you can change any of the preset colors. To do this, press and hold the jar of paint and a palette will open. Then you can choose your favorite color. Thus, all the shaded areas of the image can be changed in the coloring by number mode. You can have fun by changing the color scheme to suit your taste.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9N01WJ74X2S3","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"World Subways Simulator","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.12494.13929981371054780.063741d8-dc07-4c25-bb26-7b19114bec2c.64fbd174-637c-435a-8ac4-56f75f125e8c","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53100.13929981371054780.063741d8-dc07-4c25-bb26-7b19114bec2c.df73301b-a6f1-4c8c-b8bf-7c30aaf51407","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$0.99","Price":0.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["GameMavericks.WorldSubwaysSimulator_hzcy860754xz2"],"ContentIds":["c6ac1a46-f96c-7852-f790-ea9caf6b3bdc","9e647787-d66f-d289-af34-d95545cc01cd"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Explore the world of subway in World Subway Simulator!\r\n\r\nTrain driving simulator allows you to become a machinist and explore subway stations of the world.

The game is played with a standard deck of cards (including 2 jokers). \r\n\r\nPlayers are dealt a total of 12 cards.  The remaining 6 cards are dealt face down into the 'Kitty'.  Each player will bid starting clockwise from the dealer (dealer bids last).  \r\nThe bid consists of a bid number and description.  The bid number is the number of tricks (books) a player believes his partnership can achieve over 6. For example, a bid of 4 = 10 books. \r\n\r\nThe bid description indicates a bid direction (High or Low) or whether the bid is a 'No' trump. A bid direction of High (Uptown) indicates A,K,Q... are the highest value cards. A bid direction of Low (Downtown, Special) indicates A,2,3... are the highest value cards. A 'No' trump bid indicates that each suit has equal weight and the lead card can not be 'cut'.  The bid direction of a 'No' bid is specified after winning the bid.\r\nBid numbers can range from 3 - 7.  The Option screen gives the player the option of playing with a minimum of 3 or 4.\r\nBid descriptions have the following weights:  'No' > 'Low' > 'High'.  The Option screen allows the player to play make 'Low' and 'High' equal in weight: 'No' > 'Low' = 'High'. \r\n\r\nThe highest bidder indicates a 'trump' suit or in the case of a 'No' bid indicates the direction (High/Low).  The jokers become the highest value cards in the indicated 'trump' suit.  For example, if Diamonds were called as 'trump' the highest value cards for a 'High' direction would be:  Big Joker, Little Joker, A, K,...  In the case of a 'No' bid, the Big Joker and Little Joker have no value and should be discarded as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThe bid winner will start play as the lead player.  The remaining players must play a card in the same suit as the lead card if available. If the player does not have a card in that suit they may play another suit. The highest value card in the lead suit wins the sequence unless a trump card is played in which case the highest trump card wins the sequence. The winner of the sequence will be the lead player in the following sequence. \r\n\r\nGame Options\r\n\r\nPractice Mode:  The computer will not bid.  Allowing the player to always win bid and practice different plays.\r\nScoring - Conventional and Progressive:  With Conventional scoring the bid winner may go into negatives if the bid is not acheived.  Progressive scoring will award points to the opposition team if the bid is not achieved.\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4VMP1","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Tibetan Quest: Beyond The World's End (Full)","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45783.13510798887507764.40dd9a29-d90f-4a0d-bd3a-61861a62a496.a6f38384-4fa0-4e63-859e-f915cc25c5f5","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$6.99","Price":6.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["ArtifexMundi.TibetanQuestBeyondTheWorldsEndFull_xmkq9zz36w32m"],"ContentIds":["221f4e45-c287-1960-9369-38985ae37c0f","dd90ebb8-6519-721a-7975-63d5d8f2b36e"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,ජංගම","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"FANTASTIC HIDDEN OBJECT PUZZLE ADVENTURE GAME FROM THE CREATORS OF ENIGMATIS AND GRIM LEGENDS!\nJourney to the mystical city of Shangri-La and find your missing niece!

To conquer as much territory as possible. It's initially very simple, and the game can be mastered immediately, but watch out: there's competition, and not everyone can win!\r\nWhether you're bold or more careful, you have to be more cunning than your adversaries by finding the best strategy to conquer the most space. But be careful! You have a weak spot: your tail. If an enemy touches it, that's the end for you.\r\nTry to stay ahead, because victory in Paper.io is never certain until you possess all the territory. Stealing is allowed, and your enemies won't hesitate to do so.\r\nAfter the success of Quiz Run, 1 Pic 8 Words, and Bool, Voodoo now offers you a new gaming and graphics experience inspired by io type games (made popular by agar.io). Enjoy the simplicity and strategy of an io game in a world with unique graphics.\r\nPaper.io is for the whole family and doesn't require an Internet connection.\r\n\r\nThis player will allow you to open your favorite web games inside a self-contained UWP app.  This allows better performance, privacy, and security.

Play with your friends from Facebook or with random rivals in the network!\r\n\r\nAre you a curling fan? Then try this Ultra-Realistic, 3D, Curling Simulation Game.\r\nYou’re not a curling fan? Try Curling3D anyway and you’ll fall in love with curling and our game.\r\n\r\nCurling3D is one of the best curling simulation games for one or two players. Similar to shuffleboard, the game is played on a flat ice curling sheet, roughly 15x150 feet. Players slide round stones of about 40 pounds towards bull's eye targets at either end. Two teammates may use brooms to sweep the ice in front of the moving stone. Curling3D is a follow-up to MaxNick's successful iCurling game, and adds a new dimension of realism with 3D rendering and on-screen players. Many user suggestions have been integrated into this new curling simulation.\r\n\r\nCurling3D attempts to simulate the excitement of the game by incorporating many aspects of the actual sport. Fundamentally, curling is about force, mass, friction, momentum, rotation and collision. The app exploits the sophisticated physics engine built into the iPhone OS to generate a convincing simulation of all these elements as they interact. In the terminology of curling, the weight is the velocity of the stone; the turn is the rotation of the stone (which affects its trajectory); and the line is the direction of the throw or delivery. Curling3D allows the player to continuously and independently control all three, permitting advanced tactics such as the guard, takeout, and tap. In addition, the app allows the player to sweep the ice while their stone is moving, adjusting trajectory after the delivery.\r\n\r\nTry it… you won’t be disappointed.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH0BSRB","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Multiplication Dragons","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6886.13510798882789643.18f01640-1523-46f7-9778-d18bb1e987a7.53384c99-57e7-4d70-abb6-befd03d3bffc","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8952.13510798882789643.8c17820c-fe08-424a-b4db-1e91d76b978c.f0ec592e-4ae4-4f1b-a025-fdf5a209e1d1","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23510.13510798882789643.ea20acaa-3809-4ad6-b8b7-01fc883c39ae.510a8643-0536-4ae9-9766-6d4a111b36f9","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56364.13510798882789643.988b587e-1c51-41cc-8544-65f23f17ccd0.d439ef99-e3cd-4007-8b0f-e6563da478e4","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2553.13510798882789643.861ef00c-2d76-4406-9aad-bb5326915f7c.cc7a6f5d-8be0-4e4a-a262-8d1cfe2aba77","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4366.13510798882789643.62e66427-b7f3-47fa-bf9c-733892f604cd.6d72553e-83cc-439a-8c57-f9b5bce0ee17","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$1.99","Price":1.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["35619TioBobSoftware.MultiplicationDragons_8k2egmgf6ak18"],"ContentIds":["9c08a824-f905-b510-60a8-add89460689a","d8b60e72-78a2-42b8-300d-02ddcd3e41e6"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,ජංගම","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Memorizing multiplication tables using just a school textbook can be frustrating for you, and for your child. That’s why we have developed Multiplication Dragons, to provide new, fun ways to engage with multiplication that stimulate ease of memorization and improved recall. We all know how difficult it is to remember things without using the proper tools, and Multiplication Dragons provides just that. Our brightly colored, unique, three-dimensional environments provide visual and auditory spaces in which children can learn by associating multiplication questions with a rhyme, an in-game location, and the dragon that asks the question.\r\n\r\nMultiplication Dragons helps increase memorization and ease of recall using two memory devices that reinforce each other: rhyme and the memory palace (a.k.a. the method of loci). It will introduce your child to the world of multiplication using 3D animated dragons that guide them through 12 different environments, including a lagoon, a Halloween inspired level, a mountain, caves, a winter setting, and more! Each of the 144 questions is asked by one of our many dragons, stationed in various locations and levels throughout the game. Questions are asked using a phrase that both rhymes with the answer, and relates to the particular surroundings of the level currently being played. Multiplication questions also appear onscreen and are read aloud, a design feature used to help young readers and those experiencing difficulty reading, and to provide our dragons with a bit of extra personality. \r\n\r\nWe draw on rhyme because it has been used in various ways and has stood the test of time as a mnemonic device. After all, how many times has the age-old “thirty days has September, April, June, and November” rhyme helped you to recall the number of days in a month? It has been used for generations, and proven its success over and over again. Our second memory device, the memory palace, is one of the oldest and most successful tools in the book! This method goes back to the ancient Greeks, and involves imagining a familiar environment (like your home) and associating the things to be remembered with particular areas or aspects of that environment.  The visual and spatial qualities of this form provide additional contact points that aid in the creation of cognitive associations with the thing that we want to remember. This creates more access routes for our brains to get at the desired information, and thus increases ease of recall. By using both of these methods together we have increased these possible cognitive associations even further, while providing you and your child with hours of fun!\r\n\r\nChildren will earn 1-3 stars based on the amount of correct answers given on a level, giving them the opportunity to return to a level and break their current score. They will also get an encouraging cheer from our dragons for each right or wrong answer, and unlock new levels by successfully completing a timetable level. They can also make use of an added visual cue by reviewing the timetable itself, and test recall by attempting quiz mode. Here, your child must answer questions without the rhymes, and in random order, simulating a school math test. And unlike other games that offer one free level and then charge you for the remaining eleven, we ask for one payment which includes access to all twelve levels, quiz mode, and timetable mode.\r\n\r\nMultiplication Dragons provides your child with a whole world of exploration that introduces, reinforces, and tests multiplication skills, in a mode that feels like play. It’s time exchange the mechanical repetition of rote learning for techniques that make memorization easy and fun.

Many people believe in this even though it is not accepted as general truth…but let's start from the beginning.\r\n\r\nCheryl is an expert in paranormal activities. Nicole has called her because she was simply terrified by something that happened in her house, actually by the condition of her house.

A series of exciting sound effects punctuates your child's taps and salutes them with uplifting chimes each time the problem is successfully completed, an option parents can customize within the app's preferences menu.\r\n\r\nThe game's activities help the children develop the following basic numbers and arithmetic skills:\r\n\r\nCounting\r\n\r\nChildren can learn their numbers from 1 to 20 by counting up, or down, using the app's large, kid-friendly back and forward buttons.\r\n\r\n{Parents can choose to have the numbers spoken in one of eight languages (English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Russian, Chinese, and Japanese) and set the numbers to appear sequentially or randomly.}\r\n\r\nRecognizing and Comparing Numbers\r\n\r\nTwo activities specifically encourage your child's number comparison and recognition skills: Find the Largest Number and Find the Smallest Number. With each game, a series of hot air balloons descend from the top of the screen and bob up and down. The narrator encourages the child to pick the balloon with the largest or the smallest number.\r\n\r\nThe constant motion and varying number of the balloons, from two to four, along with the large number range, from 1 to 99, promotes concentration and quick thinking.\r\n\r\nFinding a Match\r\n\r\nParents can encourage their child's memory skills with the Find a Match game. Based on the classic turn-over tile memory game format, children are prompted to find the matching numbers hiding beneath a field of cloud-shaped tiles. The number of clouds can be set in the context menu for this activity.\r\n\r\nLearning Addition and Subtraction\r\n\r\nTwo activities guide children through the basics of addition and subtraction using apples and pears, and a third, advanced exercise, combines the two.\r\n\r\nChildren are given a problem to solve, four answer choices, and visual clues to help them find the right answer.\r\n\r\nThe advanced exercise provides a series of combined addition and subtraction problems with numerals ranging from 1 to 99. The multiple choice format of the addition and subtraction games stays the same, but this activity eliminates visual references--no orchard fruit to help your child figure out the right answer.\r\n\r\nIf you want your child to learn math--and enjoy it--you'll love Kids Numbers and Math, and so will your little one!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDG10J","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Virtual City HD (Full)","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.65051.9007199266305955.10ec8fdf-58e9-4edb-83cd-f26c704d427f.a15607c0-2323-4682-80fd-b4300d24d316","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.10648.9007199266305955.987c12d1-4eb1-4491-a018-057c0e64b8c2.7d56b0ee-6ceb-4335-8ed6-35cf338de969","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.8951.9007199266305955.f4092e98-73a0-408f-978d-d18ce2e4d53c.c5efa5d3-fcde-49c0-8477-7e3fb31fbb72","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.53468.9007199266305955.550dc46d-54fc-439d-839f-ff9e43866a8f.3acb4fd1-3346-4cbd-b812-05933d7eb09d","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.22596.9007199266305955.5bbcc217-ec11-4d71-b876-797afa6908b9.54f2adfc-46f1-437b-a6bb-534a11bc64e7","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.51968.9007199266305955.a9fad614-c5c0-4e42-a75e-7b0c0ab5a53d.69eb1ed7-a595-464c-bd45-127b84436094","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$6.99","Price":6.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["828B5831.VirtualCityFull_ytsefhwckbdv6"],"ContentIds":["938c894e-99e8-84e6-b77c-69b1f0dec35b"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"If world domination is your thing, Virtual City is a great city simulator to get you started.

Start building your transport empire by creating bus routes between as many cites as possible. You can freely build the road network and create traffic lights in order to have a better control of your traffic. \r\n\r\nThe player's company is responsible for connecting service centers to  gas stations and connecting these to other cities. This will facilitate the transportation of passengers on the buses, as the buses require fuel and servicing. Purchase a variety of bus models, based on their fuel type and consumption. Update your gas station's fuel supply to unlock newer bus models. Each bus route can accommodate a maximum of eight connections. You can build up to 30 bus stations and vehicles per game. At any time, you can upgrade your bus stations, in order to accommodate more passengers. Moreover, you can sell used vehicles to buy new and even more advanced ones.\r\n \r\nYour vehicles fuel up automatically if a road connection is available to the central gas station. But, at some point your vehicles will have to be serviced. You will have to send them to a service center (go to service), otherwise breakdowns will occur more frequently, eventually resulting in the loss of your vehicle. Road cracks also appear sometimes causing damage to your buses, so keep your roads maintained and clear of cracks. \r\n\r\nKey game features: \r\n- transport passengers between bus stations \r\n- a variety of bus models \r\n- upgrade stations to large bus hubs\r\n- upgrade gas station to offer different fuel types \r\n- beautiful night and day graphics, automatic or manual settings\r\n- build road network freely \r\n- build traffic lights to each junction\r\n- automatic breakdown generation\r\n- automatic road crack generation\r\n- various demolishing tools\r\n\r\nThe developer's notes:\r\nIf you liked the game, please provide us with feedback or a review and rate the game.

Everything is so romantic that it becomes very easy to fall in love with someone.

He has his yacht for a long period of time and he simply adores spending time in it. He has sailed a lot with his yacht so he knows the sea really well and it goes the same for the local places and the coast. However, our captain is in love with the beautiful girl named Laura.

Happy retro gaming!\r\n\r\nRocky Horror, The Fruit Machine can be played by touching the onscreen buttons (Or the corner game board icons, a real help for smaller screens) or by using a mouse-which covers most devices so happy retro gaming, all you need to provide is some real luck...\r\n\r\nTo add coins/credits to the fruit machine simply tap or click the red coin slot (Coin slot found at the top right of the fruit machine). Each tap/click of the coin slot will add four credits to the fruit machine, then just play the fruit machine like you normally would do. \r\n\r\nThe main features of Rocky Horror, The Fruit Machine include;\r\n\r\n-Trail Mystery Bonus Features-(When the trail is on number four you can select a random trail mystery bonus feature which may help you to either get a prize win or increase the trail number you are currently on, depending on the feature and most of the time they are a real help to the player. The mystery bonus features available include Random Rocket, Showskill, 3 Shot, Nudge, etc ...).\r\n\r\n-Trail Nudges, Nudge Gamble, Nudge Buster-(Trail nudges can be offered as a trail mystery bonus feature and are also offered randomly whilst playing the trail part of the fruit machine. When trail nudges are offered they are sometimes offered with a nudge gamble too and when you have trail nudges available you may use the nudge buster button to move all of the three main reels down one position at the cost of just one nudge, a real useful button indeed).\r\n\r\n-Hi-Lo Gamble-(When you get a prize win on the fruit machine or the trail number is nine or more, you will be offered an optional prize/trail hi-lo gamble. Here you can either collect your prize, gamble with a hi-lo or possibly exchange to the game board if available. If you gamble and lose, you will lose the gambled prize/trail, if you gamble and win though you will improve your prize/trail by one position/slot and if you have an exchange to game board offer, then that offer may improve too. If you are lucky and get to the top of the prize/trail board you will automatically win the trail jackpot repeater).\r\n\r\n-Exchange To Game Board-(When you get a prize win on the fruit machine or the trail number is nine or more, you may be offered an exchange to the game board. An exchange to the game board is offered when the tubes are lit in the tube slot next to the prize/trail amount you are currently on. When offered an exchange to game board amount, it will mirror the prize/trail slot you are currently on, the higher the slot, the better the game board exchange offer. The exchange offer may improve every time a hi-lo gamble is won, except on a trail jackpot repeater win).\r\n\r\n-Game Board/Tubes-(Once exchanged to the game board you can gamble and spin to try to add to or light up/activate the tubes or collect a tube if it’s active. The tubes consist of a cash tube, a grab tube, a nudge tube and a features tube which all offer different games and the higher the tube, the better. To select an active/lit up tube you can either press its corresponding button or press the corresponding corner icon on the game board. If any of the tubes reach the tube jackpot repeater slot you will automatically start the tube jackpot repeater game).\r\n\r\nThere are many more features like the board mystery bonus games, tile games, tube games/features, holds, trail holds, real fun and too many to list and explain in detail. The game also has retro sound effects, all in all, a lot of real retro fun in one retro fruit machine-happy retro gaming!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NJVW5MHVK5W","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Dark Dimensions: Blade Master","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9669.13673048518126994.f1b78418-ed3c-42ff-bc2b-84a918bef979.385b91bf-c52d-4088-83d5-e5cfa9372a86","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41443.13673048518126994.f1b78418-ed3c-42ff-bc2b-84a918bef979.e0687838-3767-4054-b728-e7a06b183e87","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13009.13673048518126994.7360d3bb-1fbe-474e-91ec-1701caca1837.d4b575b5-bcd8-4322-aecd-a354f292c79a","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30601.13673048518126994.7360d3bb-1fbe-474e-91ec-1701caca1837.7ff9f9ca-8926-4d0e-86ed-96bf802e11f6","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$9.99","Price":9.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["BigFishGames.DarkDimensionsBladeMaster_bsrvrvej7yy2w"],"ContentIds":["5a6b60e7-31d4-4b92-2f23-b9bf50446032"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Daily Magic proudly presents the next installment of the Dark Dimensions series!

At this place, sonatas spread out of palace windows and quiet baroque gardens show up behind great grandiose gates. The fact that the city's centuries-old architecture has been hardly scratched during the Second World War, makes it an appropriate setting to a way of life that gave us the term Bohemian.\r\n\r\nAshley is a journalist in one New York magazine that searches for the most romantic places in the world. She has never been to Prague, but according to what she read and hear about it, it could definitely be one of the most romantic cities in the world. However, she used to make her columns based on facts and that's why she asks her editor to allow her a trip to Prague. She would like to take a closer look at the city and then write her own column about it. She is quite prepared and knows which places should she visit, but also she will find something at the place as well.\r\n\r\nAshley's editor was kind enough so she gave her the opportunity to visit Prague. At the moment she is in Prague where she starts her romantic journey. Through her search we will also see the most beautiful places in Prague and enjoy this bohemian city.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NVF9NZCN3S6","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Typing Instructor Tomb Typer","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52984.14395902760763957.21d2cee0-719e-4fef-8850-3ae4ff8229ba.0ca864fe-17d6-44f1-81c4-c2d86636c0f3","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19380.14395902760763957.0c0b672e-e603-455f-b4b9-7aa7f3bd774d.80df6a7f-2ae8-454f-89bf-855ab2991f82","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"USD$4.99","Price":4.99,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["IndividualSoftware.TombTyper-TypingInstructor_p27trh1f1z4np"],"ContentIds":["2078be8f-0a3e-7601-29bb-84473dcd75bd"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Type your way out of the tomb and find the treasures within, before your time runs out.
