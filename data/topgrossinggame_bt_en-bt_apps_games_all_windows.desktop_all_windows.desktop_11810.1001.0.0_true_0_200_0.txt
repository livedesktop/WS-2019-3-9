In this derby simulator limiting car damage is key to becoming victorious and how you smash into other cars makes a big difference.

Recall your childhood!\r\n\r\nLudo game that traces its lineage to 6th century India. Ludo is derived from game Pachisi. Ludo is also very similar to Spanish board game.\r\n\r\nLudo game has stayed popular throughout the ages, varying only a little in its game structure. This persevering game is now available for you to play in an all new modernized format, i.e. as a video game application.\r\n\r\nThe game is played between 2 to 4 players and you have the option of playing the game against the computer, against your friends, or even against people from around the world. The objective of the game is pretty straightforward; each player gets 4 tokens, these tokens must make a full turn of the board and then make it to the finish line.\r\n\r\nWhoever gets all four tokens to the end first is the winner. However, each move can only be made based on the number decided by casting a six-sided die, and each token can only move out of their home by casting a six. Additionally, the competition factor of the games is upped by the fact that while moving if another player’s token lands on the same square as your token, then your token will automatically be sent back home and you’ll need to roll a six again.\r\n\r\nLudo King is a game that was played by kings and now it can be enjoyed by you and your family and friends. While the game play might seem simple at first, the game is immensely enjoyable and challenging. You’ll be playing this one for hours and its fun for the whole family. Try to beat your opponents and compete for the highest scores on the leaderboards.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4STNK","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Nail Salon - Princess Nail Art Mania","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35433.13510798887588106.4ccb5821-2eff-4a99-a4ac-10f8fa77e601.6e0efa83-20b4-41dc-9b21-8ebd94bbeed7","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59876.13510798887588106.39ae3121-161d-45d0-8779-6d36dcaa958a.54550db4-e8e4-45ba-b183-61703a5652aa","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18748.13510798887588106.8a99c2f7-5363-4c20-a616-7cfd132b5a77.be3559a3-c707-4840-a485-3a3d6f85c94e","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13106.13510798887588106.f23799a4-bda7-4e9c-9a51-216b245b5975.1760dd2d-ac22-4a27-914d-4c99425c2001","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.43644.13510798887588106.8aa1b350-4f1e-456b-bdc7-9d951d68f064.6a170ed2-d3af-4fe3-bb90-8cc432e42b51","Height":434,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59255.13510798887588106.69c2c948-0f5f-4c19-a322-9af28996773d.e44a3e81-e454-40a8-b072-1b4bcd2ce1b5","Height":558,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39528.13510798887588106.8d551093-0f01-417e-ae43-33c2a39e7765.1499b25f-61fd-4ed8-9c5e-5631e743085d","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23198.13510798887588106.b474235e-8f28-4a11-a1b9-1a794aa00ecb.596a804c-c7f1-4b57-8593-c66b202e8743","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3284.13510798887588106.f4e4fec7-246c-45a3-bff0-4cc68bf24fe7.f7140970-0da3-4c5a-b767-173e352c6ecc","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1763.13510798887588106.43e8380a-d326-4a77-b70a-023ab4be52b3.affe858c-506b-4ee8-9bfc-19cc49fb91c9","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["UnitMGames.NailSalon-PrincessNailArtMania_tt48tp7szpztr"],"ContentIds":["97ec9674-dfd2-413a-52be-7a4206faf7b3","aab83e01-c4bc-bc71-b896-75ca5be7c431"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"❤✮ Want to get a manicure?

looking for a fun yet comprehensive Rubber and Chicago Bridge game then look no further.  The 2019 edition of Bridge features faster and stronger game play with smoother user interface.\r\n\r\nBridge is a card game played by four players who form two partnerships. Players within a partnership face each other across the bridge table. Traditionally, the players are referred to by the points of the compass - North, East, South and West. The two partnerships are North/South and East/West. Games are played to the best of three.  During bidding, each partnership exchanges information to decide a contract. Once established the cards are played with the declarer attempting to fulfill the contract + the opponents attempting to defeat it.\r\n\r\nBridge includes the all new state of the art advanced Bridge card play engine playing at a significantly stronger level. By analysing the probable permutations of the remaining cards Bridge will frequently find an extra trick to make or defeat a contract. \r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE:\r\nThis game is ad-funded.

This is absolute madness as the block has been turned into a dead zone jungle. It is time to defend national pride and bring in the big guns. This invasion calls for direct action!\r\n\r\nIt is up to heroic little you to defend the neighbourhood. In this epic turret defence game you are building an army of block defenders with unique skills. You will need to use your fantasy and imagination to conquer the Blockheads once and for all!\r\n\r\nPOWERFUL WEAPONS\r\nLuckily you have some toys to your disposal that can push back the alien invasion.\r\n\r\nBouncer:\r\nBouncers throw tiny bombs that do quite some splash damage. Cheap to build, but has limited range and is best used in large numbers. Summoning bouncers is always a good idea!\r\n\r\nSniper:\r\nShoots enemies from a great distance with a powerful shot. This tower unit has a very wide range and can easily snipe baddies from a far. Unfortunately the sniper does need quite some time to reload itself, but it remains your strongest long range shooter.\r\n\r\nFan:\r\nThe fan unit is not developed to provide a cool breeze in the heat of battle. Instead this fan is very powerful and slows down the approaching army of enemies with a sonic blast. Your other units can then take time and annihilate the competition! Range is quite limited so it is best to place this unit at junctions and close to your other towers.\r\n\r\nTesla turret:\r\nEvery strategy game needs a tesla coil right? This is the most powerful of your units, but also one of the most expensive. It has good range and does a lot of damage. Reload time is relatively quick and it fries enemies with a powerful electrical laser. This is hell-fire of the highest order!\r\n\r\nTurbolaser (from a certain galaxy):\r\nIn later levels you will need this powerful anti air unit as it is the only Block Defender that can shoot flying enemy types. Its X - ray range is limited and you will most likely need a couple of these to counter incoming squadrons. Luckily they are relatively cheap to produce. It can not defend against ground based targets.\r\n\r\nECONOMICS\r\nThese weapons should be sufficient and up to the task. The biggest challenge however, especially in later levels are your economics. You will find that you might need to sell units on the fly in order to purchase new ones. Robots and Blockheads are relentless in their march and it is key to pay attention to where the threat is coming from and what the best counter measures are!\r\n\r\nIn short Block Defender offers a real challenge and with episode unlocks there is always something new just around the corner. And you know what they say - a strategy game a day keeps the brain doctor away!\r\n\r\nKey Features\r\n+ 3 worlds to conquer\r\n+ 30 challenging levels to complete\r\n+ Defend against land, sea and air units \r\n+ 5 powerful units to master (4 ground / 1 air)\r\n+ Many different enemy types to defeat\r\n+ Lite or premium game-play\r\n+ Unique graphical

Teleport around, explore the arena, have a conversation, or do a silly dance together. Once you are ready, join into the arena for a casual game. Simply guess what someone else is drawing or draw something for others to guess. NEW: multiplayer MR Paintball, splatter your friends or the arena with lovely colors. Remember to dodge and refill!\r\n\r\nFollow us on Twitter at https://twitter.com/Paint_Arena and share videos or screenshots of your best 3D paintings or MR paintball games with hashtag #Paint_Arena :)\r\n\r\nConceptualization: \r\nMany virtual reality games today are designed to enhance graphic intensity and immersion, but increasingly isolate the players. We believe Windows Mixed Reality can be much more than that. We decided to design a casual game that people of all ages can play, share, and socialize in mixed reality. We were inspired by a classic interactive puzzle game for friends and family, while we were amazed by the potential of the mixed reality motion controllers, so Paint Arena was born. Many thanks to Mixed Reality Academy for the paint brush example.  \r\n\r\nInstructions:\r\nYou will need a HoloLens or a WMR immersive headset with a mixed reality motion controllers (and headphones, if not Samsung Odyssey) to enjoy this experience.\r\n\r\nThis social experience is best enjoyed in a casual standing pose. If you feel you are not at the right height after app launch, simply stand up, look forward, and say or tap \"Reset Floor Level\". \r\n\r\nYou could draw and talk to others and guess each others' drawings. If you are the first one to join, you would be assigned the drawer for the first round. You would be given a random word. Draw something to help others guess the word (without drawing any letters or digits). Once someone guesses your word correctly, a guesser will chosen at random to become the drawer. \r\n\r\nToggle \"Painting On\" to \"Paint Balling\" to start shooting paintballs and splatter the arena. Each full tank contains 100 paintballs. Every 5 seconds, you can partially refill the tank with 20 paintballs by pressing \"Refill 20 Paintballs\" button or saying the voice command \"Refill Paint Ball\". Try to move around to dodge incoming paintballs, or teleport to reposition. Score by reducing others' health bars to zero, upon which they would enter ghost mode and respawn at a random location in 10 seconds. \r\n\r\nIn Immersive headsets: Make sure you set up boundary for all experiences before you begin. While \"Painting On\", once you see your robotic right hand holding a paint brush, you can press the right hand trigger button to start drawing. While \"Paint Balling\", you can aim with your right hand controller, and press right hand trigger to shoot paintballs.\r\n\r\nOnce you see your robotic left arm holding a motion controller, you can use the touch pad to select paint color. Alternatively, you can tap \"Pick Color\" to bring up the large color wheel. \r\n\r\nIf you made a mistake, you can say \"Erase Last Stroke\" or press right hand controller grab button. You can also clear all strokes by saying \"Erase All Strokes\". \r\n\r\nTo rotate your view, point the joysticks left or right on one of the motion controllers. \r\n\r\nTo teleport, make sure the panel shows \"Teleport On\". Then point your cursor at the floor with one of the motion controllers, and hold the joystick forward until a Teleport marker appears, then release the joystick. \r\n\r\nIn HoloLens, you can use gaze, tap gesture to select options on the menu in front of you (look below chest level). You can use the same voice commands as elaborated above. While \"Painting On\", you can reach your hand out in front of you, pinch and hold while dragging the paint brush along. While \"Paint Balling\", you can aim with your gaze and air tap to shoot paintballs.\r\n\r\nBefore teleporting in HoloLens, make sure the panel shows \"Teleport On\". Then you can use your gaze to aim, and then tap to dash across the map! You could also hide the Guessing Window and the Panel if they are blocking your gazes. Remember to turn off teleport before drawing or shooting. \r\n\r\n\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NJKB5951KQK","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Lep's Craft World Run","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31308.13675030463835958.387d8bf0-5ea8-4b74-be62-6cad59f94f4f.2b4461b5-f456-4418-97fa-f3f9d9ea2f4a","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15567.13675030463835958.387d8bf0-5ea8-4b74-be62-6cad59f94f4f.eb4efa94-7f15-4396-9c96-ef23c7677e86","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54875.13675030463835958.5d13a08d-d2f4-4bdd-bcfa-c236f3c32951.2ca9d707-4848-4cfb-afae-d694afcab34c","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["48789CrazyLabs.LepsCraftWorldRun_dwg8ngpkyyxjc"],"ContentIds":["4357601c-df33-1dde-b282-a194bb799286","be8dd50a-21ed-567d-8c2f-57195ff76d17"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Classic jumping mario game, bring back your memory of childhood!
