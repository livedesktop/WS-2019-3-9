codes!\r\n\r\nNo matter if the QR code contains a URL, a business card or if it’s a barcode. QR Scanner+ knows them all and doesn’t just show the scanned content, but does a great post processing and shows it finely detailed. \r\n\r\nUsage is childishly simple. Just point on a code and the result will show immediately at the bottom together with the most recent functions in the app bar. The menus on the left and right side can be opened easily with a tap on the button in the app header, or just swiped in from the edge. Onehanded use is simply a breeze. \r\n\r\nBesides the scanning using the camera, QR Scanner+ also offers the possibility to read codes located on images. If needed, QR Scanner+ can save scanned codes in the ‘Catalog’ for later use.\r\n\r\nQR Scanner+ does support following content types:\r\n- URL\r\n- Windows Store URL\r\n- contact information / business cards (vCard, meCard, bizCard)\r\n- calendar event / appointments (vEvent)\r\n- geo-location\r\n- eMail address\r\n- eMail message\r\n- phone number\r\n- SMS\r\n- WiFi (connect with a single tap)\r\n- text\r\n- SEPA Credit Transfer (Giro Code)\r\n- barcodes\r\n\r\nWhen searching products by scanning a barcode, QR Scanner+ can deliver results that are most useful. Simply choose from a selection of most common search providers or type in a custom one. You can choose Bing, Baidu, DuckDuckGo, Google, Yandex or a custom URL to e.g Amazon, Ebay, Pricegrabber, Idealo... With this approach QR Scanner+ can deliver the information you are searching for.\r\n\r\nYou should just try QR Scanner+ and convince yourself. If you’re not happy at all, you can simply send in your feedback. ;-)\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDP7SX","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"Concise Oxford Thesaurus","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24576.9007199266621543.ae9d09b9-3e6f-41c0-a5eb-ef3eaa4e9a39.11af4ae6-443f-4e24-9d6a-af6696b8b018","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42840.9007199266621543.2f01c171-b021-48fa-960f-9995fa87a5cb.fd5f48ed-cc93-40a2-a377-e4a5f2ce634f","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44516.9007199266621543.40de7de8-1bbf-4a7a-bc1e-e35fc075a9ba.14eb1b5d-6f87-4e99-a671-4b5beb531968","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"₹434.00","Price":434.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["MobiSystems.ConciseOxfordThesaurus_8m57vzdwnbybp"],"ContentIds":["19de9ab9-524a-07c0-9edb-cc52f2bdaa78","7185cb02-fdbb-3d63-8833-4a5c1950bece"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,మొబైల్","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"The Concise Oxford Thesaurus is aimed at helping you find exactly the right word, whether you're writing a letter, preparing a report, composing an essay, or solving a crossword.\r\n\r\nOver 300,000 alternative words cover everyday vocabulary as well as more unusual and specialist words, alongside a clear indicator of informal, dialect, literary, and technical items.

Regardless of the number of correct answers given, and of stars earned, the child's developing skills will be fostered by enthusiastic applause and floating balloons!\r\n\r\nThe educational flashcards for tots are divided into the following categories: berries, fruits, vegetables, flowers, mushrooms, the environment (sea, island, forest, river, mountain, etc.), the seasons, and natural phenomena (rain, rainbow, sunset, lightning, etc.). \r\n\r\nOne important feature makes this educational app stand out from the rest: instead of drawings, which are not always easy to identify, the child will see beautiful, colorful photographs of each object and phenomenon. \r\n\r\nClearly, it is not so easy to show real live lightning, rainbow or erupting volcano to a child. This educational app allows the child to “see” many natural objects and phenomena as they appear in reality, while allowing parents to tell the child more about them. \r\n\r\nDoes the youngster have an older brother or sister in grade school? They can also use this educational game! Besides English, this app also supports the German, Russian and Ukrainian languages. \r\n\r\nWhile playing with flashcards in a foreign language, a school-age child can effortlessly learn many new words with which to surprise their foreign language teachers and classmates. An A+ is sure to follow! \r\n\r\nIn order to use this educational app, the youngster does not need to be able to read. The simple interface and spoken clues allow even the youngest of children to play and learn independently!\r\n\r\nExperience has shown that children love to look through a series of colorful pictures with sounds, and they will ask to see them again and again. According to Glenn Doman, an American physical therapist and the founder of The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential, participating in these kinds of educational activities (for 5-10 minutes a day) stimulates the development of various regions in the brain. As a result, the child's photographic memory takes shape, the child develops much faster than his or her peers, and, beginning at infancy, the child gains access to a world of encyclopedic knowledge. \r\n\r\nThe main point, in which Doman is undoubtedly correct, is that the younger a child, the more easily he or she can absorb new knowledge. It's important to make use of this ability while it's available!\r\n\r\nThe app can be used as a supplementary teaching aid in foreign language instruction. Supported languages: English, Spanish, French, German, Russian, Polish, Ukrainian.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDSM0J","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"SongBook","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6885.9007199266592219.5b8c1cc7-cc2c-434f-b56c-aef035e55bed.c0c38547-abf2-4d15-8d6d-476fd049352a","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60289.9007199266592219.fbeb721f-d116-4013-a641-46b8205bf3c6.b7a601c1-eab3-45c3-8a53-e308899fdfdf","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63126.9007199266592219.5d4a06b5-8cf5-40d5-be8a-04d4a07fa0d6.accedb0b-0b20-49ef-8568-dea8a869adaa","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34112.9007199266592219.64507624-da50-4c95-b9cd-737691165994.aeee5c33-91de-45a0-b02b-bfdfab57eb94","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58650.9007199266592219.a5b31c34-af61-4df4-8fb4-338b62d3e03f.45cf72e5-2c53-4950-a093-296d33c34b6f","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14454.9007199266592219.d873b33a-2bdf-4a60-b0de-5ed3d4b4b148.03da6dfe-ac13-464c-9943-6e0b8f8c9f69","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23098.9007199266592219.b1ec37a9-a900-4cce-929b-bc177665b2dc.999f9871-a628-4ca4-afbf-0f6642d79db9","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36251.9007199266592219.2d6ecc57-8b4b-427a-96fc-74c681f4a3a4.5f2183f6-e8bd-44fc-a9ff-63acfea7cad1","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14755.9007199266592219.f8a6047d-02c0-4a2c-9016-de7839d75a9a.a9f12db5-096c-4d73-a724-2dce4ca10be1","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"₹824.00","Price":824.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["LinkeSOFTGmbH.SongBook_z1ecgzm83vdtm"],"ContentIds":["b413e544-f320-e21c-071c-1710dec085be","c73011b2-e898-fcee-355e-ef9684e8c8ab"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,మొబైల్","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Great for professional and amateur musicians alike, SongBook manages your song collections with lyrics and chords.

The words are usually less frequent in daily but occasionally appear in IELTS exam, specially in reading section. If you are ready for basic IELTS vocabulary, this is a good option to enrich your high score IELTS words. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are special features of IELTS High Score Words? \r\nThis app isn't only a word list. It lets students mark each word with one of three status: New, Known, and Need Reviewed. So you can skip known words, review half-known words, and focus on new words. This mechanism ensures you never waste time on known words, keep fast pace and high productivity in your IELTS test preparation. \r\n\r\n\r\nHow can I save word status for future use? \r\nIELTS High Score Words will save word status at your computer or other device for future use automatically. \r\n\r\n\r\nIs there any difference among this Windows 8 Store version and other versions? \r\nAll versions of IELTS High Score Words from www.examword.com share same word list in general. We commonly update word list and its definitions per year, but cannot update all versions at same day, so at particular period tiny difference possibly is among these versions. As for software features, separate versions have different merits based on the natures of various devices.","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFHVNL","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Survivalcraft","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.35161.9007199266248685.47303be2-ecd3-45df-80b3-85ce086101d3.1c96e12e-7ae7-410d-ad26-af5c41a05512","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.21823.9007199266248685.01c6dd15-b2c7-4b7f-98fb-9453b2a8dd87.06a81dfa-6f31-48ad-a054-e834deeeffd2","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.2724.9007199266248685.3f955cf6-6236-4f29-a241-5885b95b985e.472eef10-4cf1-4785-bcba-8a6aee3075e1","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"₹219.00","Price":219.0,"AverageRating":4.3,"RatingsCount":"16","PackageFamilyNames":["20961CandyRufusGames.Survivalcraft_c7jxg4av36ap6"],"ContentIds":["a4b4f506-706c-089d-34f4-8e76f9ce2b62","6f594fc7-cd97-ce7d-a36e-11fd57b08a8a","a03df1d8-c81b-f637-bdf8-4a4e13d3d40b"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,మొబైల్","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"You are marooned on the shores of an infinite blocky world.

WITH SPEECH RECOGNITION ( https://youtu.be/NQ-tktKTha4 )\r\nTeleprompter Pro is designed to produce scrolling text used by professional TV companies and movie producers.  Teleprompter Pro is the most user friendly and feature rich teleprompter available in the Windows Store.  Teleprompter Pro goes much further than standard teleprompters with inbuilt functionality to record your performance.  It also includes advance features like dual screen and voice recognition control.  All at a fraction of the cost of teleprompters with less functionality.  Teleprompter Pro is ideal for video and podcast production.  The software allows configurable scroll speed, text size and colours.   You can also load and save scripts from standard text files.  It can also be used for learning song lyrics.   The scrolling text can also be mirrored and inverted for use with teleprompter hardware.

Use your cunning to kill or tame the primeval creatures roaming the land, and encounter other players to survive, dominate... and escape! \r\n\r\nTAME, TRAIN, BREED & RIDE DINOSAURS, IN A LIVING ECOSYSTEM\r\nOver 50 creatures can be tamed using a challenging subdue-&-protect process. Weaken a feral creature to knock it out, and then nursing it to health. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your Pet, which it may follow depending on how well you’ve tamed and trained it. Pets continue to level-up and consume food, and carry Inventory and Equipment.  Fly a Pteranodon over the mountains, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, or chase down prey on a T-Rex! Experience a dynamic ecosystem with its own predator & prey hierarchies. Breed Pets through successive generations to generate the best traits. Or put more simply, breed & raise Dino Babies!\r\n\r\nFOOD, WATER, TEMPERATURE AND WEATHER\r\nEat and drink to survive, with different foods having different nutritional values (including human meat!). All actions drain food and water, and long-distance travel is draining. Inventory weight slows you down, and the day/night cycle and weather alter the environment. Craft clothing, build shelter, and use fire to protect yourself against damage & the elements.\r\n\r\nHARVEST, CRAFT, AND PAINT ITEMS\r\nHarvest trees, ore, and more to become a master crafter. Use your hands, a Smithy, or a Fabricator to craft increasingly complex and powerful gear. Build a massive base using modular pieces--ranging from Thatch, to Wood, to Stone, to Metal. Customize your base by painting it and placing signs that you can actually draw on. Weapons, clothing, & armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.\r\n\r\nSUMMON THE ULTIMATE LIFE FORMS\r\nBring rare items to special Summon locations to awaken the ARK’s mythical creatures, who arrive ready for battle. These monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced Tribes and their Pets, and yield valuable items if they are defeated.\r\n\r\nRPG STATISTICS\r\nLevel-Up your survivor by gaining experience through in-game actions to learn new crafting Engrams, or find higher level item Blueprints in the most dangerous parts of the ARK. Customize the look of your character with a complex character creation system.\r\n\r\nHARDCORE MECHANICS\r\nItems have durability and wear out with use if not repaired. When you leave the game, your character remains “sleeping” in the persistent world. Your inventory also exists in the persistent world, vulnerable to theft. Death means permanent loss, and you can even enslave other players for your own purposes.\r\n\r\nLARGE WORLD PERSISTENCE\r\nOn the 70+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your pets stay in-game even when you leave. Special themed events will occur in the world with corresponding limited-run items!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRCWF3L","TileLayout":"Square","Title":"myTube!","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.10780.9007199267035455.9033761d-e569-4e59-8bb7-f803d1b4f098.5e4b5bac-f322-48d2-8c10-9bc3b638e36a","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"₹54.00⁺","Price":54.0,"AverageRating":4.7,"RatingsCount":"55","PackageFamilyNames":["59750RykenApps.435307C335C44_zd92nzxdcatqw"],"ContentIds":["a89c2921-18e4-57d3-d422-936a181e762e","da611fee-e0d2-5388-641b-f7a7c0f96ce7","d0ea149f-74b1-9516-247d-18954a34df39","a9825e72-f64c-dedc-d3d9-5ec3476fd0b3","aa1bb248-ce06-e0a9-878e-79314405c8f2"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"   ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Xbox One,HoloLens,మొబైల్","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"The best YouTube experience around.\r\n\r\nmyTube is a YouTube app built to keep your video playing no matter what.

This is an excellent family story with a paranormal twist!\r\n\r\nYour family’s past is more interesting than any story. And it's not over yet...\r\n \r\nOne of my father’s stories was my favorite: “Once upon a time there lived a merchant with his wife. The family was happy and had never known grief. However, their maid, Julianne, was jealous of the little family's happiness and secretly dreamed of taking the place of a beloved wife. She learned of unholy powers hidden deep within the manor that could be summoned by a ritual … although there was a cost. She cursed the merchant's wife, unleashed deadly powers. The merchant vows to devote the rest of his life to finding a way to release his beloved wife from her cursed world.”\r\n\r\nYears have passed. My father dies, but he leaves me a message: “Your favorite fairy tale was the true story of our family. I tried to free your mother's spirit, but I failed. I beg you to finish what I could not. The solution is waiting in our old family home.”\r\n\r\nAs a son, I must “write” the happy ending for my family’s story.\r\n\r\nThis puzzle adventure is perfect for playing while traveling.

Good thing Deep Rock Galactic employs the best space miners in the universe: Dwarves! Combining two things Dwarves love most - mining and killing monsters - Hoxxes is the perfect job for any proud, space-faring Dwarf.\r\n\r\n*** 4-player Co-Op ***\r\nWork together as a team to dig, explore, and fight your way through a massive cave system filled with hordes of deadly enemies and valuable resources.

MUSIC, NATURALLY.\r\nStaffPad is a groundbreaking music notation application, featuring advanced handwriting recognition. Write music, using your digital pen*, and StaffPad will transform your handwritten notation into a beautifully typeset score which you can then edit, play back, print and share. For composers and musicians, StaffPad revolutionises the art of writing music.\r\n\r\n*IMPORTANT NOTE: STAFFPAD **REQUIRES** A DEVICE WITH ACTIVE PEN CAPABILITIES. DESIGNED FOR SURFACE.\r\n\r\nMUSIC RECOGNITION\r\nStaffPad has been designed from the ground up for pen input. Simply write your music straight on to the screen, using your device’s pen. As you move from bar to bar, StaffPad will convert your handwriting into a beautifully engraved score. You can draw notes, beams, stems, articulations, accidentals, slurs, ties and more. It’s the most natural way to write music on digital device, ever.\r\n\r\nAN ORCHESTRA IN THE TIP OF YOUR PEN\r\nStaffPad contains a bespoke playback engine, and an entire orchestra which has been meticulously recorded and programmed to play back your score with incredible realism. Multiple dynamics layers, multiple recorded articulations, repetition samples and smart playback rules ensure that what you see is what you hear. The entire symphony orchestra is represented, and more instruments are available to purchase from the in-app store.\r\n\r\nStaffPad is powerful. Everything from a basic piano lead sheet to a full symphony score can be written with StaffPad.\r\n\r\nA BEAUTIFUL EXPERIENCE\r\nWriting music should be the focus of a composer. StaffPad handles everything else for you whilst you work. The interface has been designed to reduce clutter, and is context sensitive - showing only the information you want, when you want it.\r\n\r\nPEN AND TOUCH\r\nBy combining the power of digital inking and multitouch, we can offer a no-compromises approach to virtual manuscript. Use your finger to move around the score, and pinch to zoom - with butter-smooth scrolling. When you want to write music, just use the pen. Use your eraser button on the pen to remove both ink strokes and existing notation. You can also draw freehand on the score, using the sketch layer, to quickly brainstorm and leave notes/comments for yourself and others.\r\n\r\nPRINT YOUR RESULTS\r\nStaffPad will intelligently layout the score when it’s time to print. You can print the entire score, as well as individual parts for each musician. StaffPad has smart collision avoidance and music layout rules which handle the reflowing of the music to a page-based layout automatically.\r\n\r\nSHARE YOUR WORK\r\nStaffPad allows you to easily share and export your work. You can export MIDI and MusicXML, should you wish to continue working on your score in other programs. You can also export your score to MP3/WAV format, or quickly email an MP3 of your work in just a couple of taps. StaffPad also supports import of MusicXML and MIDI files.\r\n\r\nSCORE SYNC AND AUTO-SAVE\r\nStaffPad is always saving your score, and keeping track of versions - which you can return to at anytime. By saving your scores to OneDrive, you can ensure that your scores are kept in sync across all your devices. StaffPad also syncs your settings and preferences. You can also organise your scores into ‘collections’, meaning that your scores and projects stay neatly organised, for easy access. You can even pin frequently accessed scores straight to the Start Screen.\r\n\r\nCOMPOSER ASSISTANT\r\nA voice activated composer assistant allows you to interact with your score using your voice. Want to change the key signature to G major at bar 10? No problem - tap the assistant and say \"Change to G major at bar 10\". The assistant can quickly help you set up your score, adding instruments, setting the tempo, the key signature, the time signature, adding barlines, playing from rehearsal marks or specific bars, printing, exporting and transposing your score. Currently, the voice assistant is available in US and UK English only.\r\n\r\nEXPRESS YOURSELF\r\nStaffPad is the first notation application which allows you to easily draw dynamics/music expression data right onto the staff. By toggling the expression layer, you can elegantly draw in additional dynamics detail, which can enhance the realism of playback without compromising the existing dynamics markings on your score.\r\n\r\nPROFESSIONAL FEATURES\r\nStaffPad intelligently handles transposing instruments, allowing you to write in concert pitch and toggle to transposing when you’re ready, or when printing. You can write music in multiple voices, transpose selections, reverse stem directions, quickly repeat bars and insert text intuitively via the  quick input tiles. Quick symbols provide the easiest way to enter trills, tremolos, fermatas, rehearsal marks, pedal markings, hairpins and much more.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION\r\nStaffPad is designed for professional composers and musicians, but it’s also a great learning tool for students. Within the application there are multiple video tutorials explaining how to use the app, and key musical concepts. \r\n\r\nCOMPATIBILITY:\r\nStaffPad REQUIRES a device with a digital pen (also known as an active digitiser) and multitouch capabilities in order to function as designed*. If your device does not support pen and touch, the app will not function correctly.

Race through canyons in Australia, test your skills in the most wonderful glaciers of Argentina, or immerse yourself in the most beautiful forests of Spain. \r\n\r\nKey Features:\r\n\r\n✔ Awesome graphics\r\n✔ Very realistic physics\r\n✔ Real bike and quad models: 125cc, 250cc, 450cc... 2-Stroke and 4-Stroke engines\r\n✔ Amazing worldwide locations (27 different tracks in 9 locations)\r\n✔ Leaderboards and achievements\r\n✔ In-game Camera feature to take pictures\r\n✔ Game-pad and keyboard support\r\n\r\nEnduro racing is a somewhere between MX and Trials sports. You ride in outdoor locations on a time-based race. The goal is to complete each round as fast as possible, but World Enduro Rally will give you bonus time if you perform stunts like backflips, frontflips (and other hidden stunts), and will add penalty time each time you re-spawn.\r\n\r\nEnduro bikes are heavy, and controlling tilt is sometimes hard. They don't brake much either, so you need to plan your speed carefully. The game includes speed signs to give you tips about when you can drive fast, or when you should drive slowly. \r\n\r\nMore bikes and locations will keep coming! \r\n\r\nWe’re on Twitter (@WEnduroRally) and Facebook (@worldEnduroRally).","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

Users can easily enjoy genuine Asian calligraphy and ink wash painting with a simple and intuitive user interface imbued with the Zen spirit.\r\n\r\nThe Windows universal app version of Zen Brush 2 already supports the Surface Dial and the new Surface Pen with tilt support, providing the feeling of a real ink brush by reflecting the brush's tilt and orientation.\r\n\r\nMain Features :\r\n\r\n■3D Ink Brush Simulation\r\nThe app includes a drawing system based on a 3D model of an East Asian ink brush. Strokes change according to the movement of the user's finger or pen, providing a sensation just like a real ink brush for a uniquely varied and deep expressiveness.\r\n\r\n■Ink Nijimi and Notan\r\nUsers can select from 3 types of ink dispersion (nijimi) and enjoy the complex, three-dimensional expressiveness of ink-wash painting where the ink gradually soaks into washi (Japanese paper). The thickness of the ink (notan) can also be adjusted to reproduce shades ranging from dark, thick ink to light, diluted ink so users can create subtle artwork by combining shadowy depictions and light coatings.\r\n\r\n■Abundant Style Templates\r\nArtwork expressiveness is enhanced by choosing from a collection of 92 rich background style templates, including washi (Japanese paper), old paper, patterned paper and many more.\r\n\r\n■Support for Surface Dial and Surface Pen\r\nWith Surface Dial, users can use Zen Brush features intuitively without needing to touch their keyboard and mouse. Thanks to support for the Surface Pen's pressure sensing and the New Surface Pen's tilt detection, users can enjoy an even more realistic ink brush experience.\r\n\r\nFeatures :\r\n\r\n- 92 background style templates.\r\n- Simple brush size adjustment with slider.\r\n- Simple main tools: ink brush, red brush, eraser brush.\r\n- 3 levels of ink dispersion (nijimi).\r\n- 3 levels of ink tone (notan).\r\n- Guide lines (9 types).\r\n- Undo / redo (5 levels).\r\n- Save projects in the app.\r\n- Save artwork to image file (formats: JPEG / PNG / Transparent PNG (without background)).\r\n- Sharing (transfer data to other supported apps. Example: email).\r\n- Adjustable pressure sensitivity (5 levels).\r\n- Adjustable tilt sensitivity (5 levels).\r\n* Requires a pen that supports tilt.\r\n- Supports Surface Pen (eraser supported).\r\n- Supports Surface Dial (undo / redo, brush size adjustment, tool switching (ink brush, red brush, eraser), zoom in / zoom out, style change, brush axis rotation, 90 degrees canvas rotation).","ProductFamilyName":"Apps","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NSNSBW1JTJX","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Forza Motorsport 7 Deluxe Edition","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45895.14359644131418103.1152921504737973153.b2e15ef4-b5b5-4b5f-940b-30b138acfd3a","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"#FFFFFF","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26187.14359644131418103.1152921504737975035.42b6e64b-eb2c-4f40-9bb5-7e345c9693ff","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"#FFFFFF","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"₹3,724.00⁺","Price":3724.0,"AverageRating":4.6,"RatingsCount":"40","PackageFamilyNames":[""],"ContentIds":[],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Xbox One","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Experience the thrill of motorsport at the limit with the most comprehensive, beautiful and authentic racing game ever made. \r\n\r\nForza Motorsport 7 is where Racers, Drifters, Drag Racers, Tuners, and Creators come together in a community devoted to everything automotive.
