10!\r\n\r\nSolitaire remains the most played computer game of all time, and for good reason. Simple rules and straightforward gameplay make it easy to pick up for everyone.\r\n\r\nSolitaire has been part of Windows for more than 25 years, and the Microsoft Solitaire Collection makes it the best experience to date with five different card games in one:\r\n\r\nKlondike\r\nThis version is the timeless classic that many people just call \"Solitaire.\" Try to clear all the cards from the table using one or three-card draw, while using traditional scoring or the Vegas scoring system.\r\n\r\nSpider\r\nEight columns of cards await your attempts to clear them with the fewest moves possible. Start out playing with a single suit until you’re comfortable, and then see how you fare when using two or even all four suits in a game.\r\n\r\nFreeCell\r\nUse four extra cells to move cards around as you try to clear all cards from the table. More strategic than the Klondike version, FreeCell rewards players who think several moves ahead.\r\n\r\nTriPeaks\r\nSelect cards in a sequence, either up or down, to earn points and clear the board. How many boards can you clear before you run out of deals?\r\n\r\nPyramid\r\nPair two cards that add up to 13 in order to remove them from the board. Try to reach the top of the pyramid. See how many boards you can clear and how high you can score in this highly addictive card game!\r\n\r\nDaily Challenges\r\nPlayers receive new challenges each day. Complete enough Daily Challenges in a month to earn badges and compete with your friends.\r\n\r\nStar Club\r\nEven more challenges arranged in collections and packs you can unlock by earning stars.\r\n\r\nChoose Your Theme\r\nThe Microsoft Solitaire Collection features several beautiful themes, from the simplicity of \"Classic\" to the serenity of an Aquarium that comes to life before you while you play. You can even create custom themes from your own photos!\r\n\r\nXbox Live Integration\r\nSign in with your Microsoft account to earn achievements, compete with your friends on the leaderboards, and track your personal gameplay statistics.

Each stack must start with an Ace, followed by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen and end with a King.\r\n✓ At the beginning of the game, all the cards are dealt into 8 columns. At the top of the screen you will find 4 free cells and 4 foundations. Use the free cells to temporarily store one card at a time during the game.\r\n✓ Once you place a card in the foundation you cannot take it back. Make sure you no longer need it before placing it there.\r\n✓ You can move a card from one column to another if the top card from the other column is +1 higher and is of a different color. For example, you can put a 3 of hearts over a 4 of spades. Or you can put a 10 of clubs over a Jack of diamonds.\r\n✓ You can move an entire series of cards if you have enough free positions. Empty columns and empty free cells are considered free positions. The series of cards must be smaller or equal than the number of free positions plus 1. For example, if you have 2 empty free cells and one empty column you can move at most 4 cards at a time.\r\n✓ If you cannot move a stack because it is too large you can try splitting it into two parts. Then you can reassemble it in a new column.\r\n\r\n\r\n★ Support and Feedback\r\nIf you have any technical problems, please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

It’s the most popular ever happening games in many countries. \r\n\r\nLudo (from Latin ludo, \"I play\") is a strategy board game in which the players race their four tokens from start to finish according to rolls of a single die. \r\n\r\nLudo is derived from the Indian game Parchisi, but simpler. The game and its variants are popular in many countries and under various names.\r\n\r\nParchisi originated in India by the 6th century. \r\n\r\nEach player rolls the die; the highest roller begins the game. Players alternate turns in a clockwise direction.\r\n\r\nLudo can be played by two, three, or four, without partnerships. To enter a token into play from its yard to its starting square, a player must roll a 6. If the player has no tokens yet in play and rolls other than a 6, the turn passes to the next player. Once a player has one or more tokens in play, he selects a token and moves it forwards along the track the number of squares indicated by the dice. Players must always move a token according to the die value rolled. Passes are not allowed; if no move is possible, the turn moves to the next player.\r\n\r\nPlayers may not end their move on a square they already occupy. If the advance of a token ends on a square occupied by an opponent's token, the opponent token is returned to its owner's yard. The returned token can be reentered into play only when the owner rolls a 6. \r\n\r\nThe first person to move all 4 pieces into the home wins.\r\n\r\nHave you ever missed the classic family entertainment of the Ludo board that we used to play on as kids? \r\n\r\nWell now you can play Ludo Free with friends- the timeless game and enjoy it with your family and loved ones.\r\n\r\nSo why not make it a reality by playing this game and reliving your childhood days?\r\n\r\nDownload Ludo for free and recall your childhood!\r\n\r\n◆◆◆◆ Ludo Free Features ◆◆◆◆\r\n\r\n✔ 2, 3 or 4 player mode (Local co-op and Bots)\r\n✔ All time classic family ludo game\r\n✔ User friendly interface\r\n✔ Free to play\r\n\r\nPlease rate and give your feedback for Ludo Free for further improving the game.\r\n\r\nWe will be grateful to hear your opinions and improve - whenever needed - in future versions.\r\n\r\nEnjoy playing Ludo anywhere anytime, Free!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9N635QPCD7XH","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Pixel Art Color by Number Sandbox","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.21542.14021844440207044.bdc96a2b-7306-41db-8c50-416d1e600a8f.ed5bd343-7e83-46c2-8556-d40285e4a09c","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45258.14021844440207044.bdc96a2b-7306-41db-8c50-416d1e600a8f.57e593be-cfaa-4493-aae0-5faef4f12563","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.21542.14021844440207044.bdc96a2b-7306-41db-8c50-416d1e600a8f.ed5bd343-7e83-46c2-8556-d40285e4a09c","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["22876NinjaBlitzWarGames.PixelArtColorbyNumberSandb_7sghpx39xtehr"],"ContentIds":["d8f00a9e-dc4f-fb37-9fda-f6f5c0c4bdc5","3a5450d1-a7aa-6d14-52ce-39a66d224791"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Pixel Art Color by Number Sandbox is an amazing coloring book game designed for adults and children.

It is fundamentally different from most solitaire games in that very few hands are unsolvable. Although software implementations vary, most versions label the hands with a number (derived from the random number seed used to generate the hand).\r\n\r\nA version of FreeCell was created by Microsoft for release with the Windows operating system.\r\n\r\nFreeCell solitaire is one kinds of funny solitaire card game, but it's not like other solitaires. You need no luck to win, only skill is required. All cards are opened from the start and the deal has the solution, you can win, think and move wisely. \r\n\r\nKey Features: \r\n- deals with different difficulty \r\n- every completed deal has score \r\n- customizable background and card \r\n- magnetic card movement \r\n- supermove: multiple card dragging \r\n- drag or tap to move \r\n- undo option \r\n- optimized battery usage for very long gameplay \r\n\r\nRules\r\nConstruction and layout\r\nOne standard 52-card deck is used.\r\nThere are four open cells and four open foundations. Some alternate rules use between one to ten cells.\r\nCards are dealt into eight cascades, four of which comprise seven cards and four of which comprise six. Some alternate rules will use between four to ten cascades.\r\n\r\nBuilding during play\r\nThe top card of each cascade begins a tableau.\r\nTableaux must be built down by alternating colors.\r\nFoundations are built up by suit.\r\n\r\nMoves\r\nAny cell card or top card of any cascade may be moved to build on a tableau, or moved to an empty cell, an empty cascade, or its foundation.\r\nComplete or partial tableaus may be moved to build on existing tableaus, or moved to empty cascades, by recursively placing and removing cards through intermediate locations. Computer implementations often show this motion, but players using physical decks typically move the tableau at once.\r\n\r\nVictory\r\nThe game is won after all cards are moved to their foundation piles.\r\nVarious computer versions of Freecell occasionally deal unsolvable games.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nOne of the oldest ancestors of FreeCell is Eight Off. In the June 1968 edition of Scientific American, Martin Gardner described in his \"Mathematical Games\" column a game by C. L. Baker that is similar to FreeCell, except that cards on the tableau are built by suit rather than by alternate colors. Gardner wrote, \"The game was taught to Baker by his father, who in turn learned it from an Englishman during the 1920s.\" This variant is now called Baker's Game. FreeCell's origins may date back even further to 1945 and a Scandinavian game called Napoleon in St. Helena (not the game Napoleon at St. Helena, also known as Forty Thieves).\r\n\r\nPaul Alfille changed Baker's Game by making cards build according to alternate colors, thus creating FreeCell. He implemented the first computerised version of it in the TUTOR programming language for the PLATO educational computer system in 1978. Alfille was able to display easily recognizable graphical images of playing cards on the 512 * 512 monochrome display on the PLATO systems.\r\n\r\nThis original FreeCell environment allowed games with 4–10 columns and 1–10 cells in addition to the standard 8 * 4 game. For each variant, the program stored a ranked list of the players with the longest winning streaks. There was also a tournament system that allowed people to compete to win difficult hand-picked deals. Paul Alfille describes this early FreeCell environment in more detail in an interview from 2000.\r\n\r\n\r\nSolver complexity\r\nThe FreeCell game has a constant number of cards. This implies that in constant time, a person or computer could list all of the possible moves from a given start configuration and discover a winning set of moves or, assuming the game cannot be solved, the lack thereof. To perform an interesting complexity analysis one must construct a generalized version of the FreeCell game with 4 * n cards. This generalized version of the game is NP-complete; it is unlikely that any algorithm more efficient than a brute-force search exists that can find solutions for arbitrary generalized FreeCell configurations.\r\n\r\nThere are 52! (i.e., 52 factorial), or approximately 8*1067, distinct deals. However, some games are effectively identical to others because suits assigned to cards are arbitrary or columns can be swapped. After taking these factors into account, there are approximately 1.75*1064 distinct games.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

of city building and tower defense awesomeness!\r\n\r\nUNIQUE SIMULATION + STRATEGY GAMING\r\nTake back the wilderness from the invading bloon hordes and pop your way from a modest settlement to a thriving metropolis. Attack bloon-infested territory adjacent to your city, win a short tower defense game, and add the captured territory to your city as a space on which to build. Buildings are the heart of your city, and each one has a specific purpose - individual monkey towers for battle, upgrades for those towers, farms and banks to drive your economy, power to supercharge your city, epic buildings for epic powers, and decorations to make your city more awesome. Every time you build, your city looks cooler, you increase your power potential in tower defense play, and you open up even more rewards and challenges.\r\n\r\nAMAZING DEPTH AND VARIETY\r\nAll 21 of the fully awesomized and carefully balanced Bloons TD 5 towers are available within Monkey City, with completely new unlock mechanics. More than 130 buildings and decorations give you endless strategies and city design options. Explore the wilderness to find treasure tiles and uncover 11 powerful special items like the Banana Replicator and the Dark Temple Idol. Burst bloons on 55 all new tower defense maps or test your mastery on 13 wildly challenging original special missions. Either way, be ready to encounter all new bloon waves and special bloon attack patterns like Cash Starve or Fast and Furious.\r\n\r\nREINFORCE YOUR FRIENDS\r\nConnect with Facebook friends, then help each other win and expand. Send Supply Crates back and forth for bonus starting cash. Visit friends' cities to check out their strategies and their city design skills, and while you're there root out any bloon spies to win a reward for both you and your friend.\r\n\r\nSHOW OFF YOUR SKILLS\r\nBuild up the strongest lineup of monkey towers possible and compete with other players for the best score in weekly Contested Territory events. Use the latest in monkey science to send player vs. player bloon attacks, then see whose defenses are the strongest and earn extra rewards for victory.\r\n\r\nDownload for free and play Bloons Monkey City now!\r\n\r\nPlease Note:\r\nBloons Monkey City is free to download and play (aside from internet, carrier, data, device, and other services for which the player is financially responsible), but some in-game items can be purchased with real money.

You can dramatically increase your winnings with the Free Spins feature. A special symbol will be selected before the Feature Game begins. If this bonus symbol appears anywhere on the playing field, it will take over all positions on the reel on which it appears.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH43XTQ","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Parkour Simulator 3D","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42694.13510798887943643.08a41ea4-87c4-402b-a407-2c01fbc7e820.ea2568a8-b807-4373-a56b-41c8c7822707","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9719.13510798887943643.08a41ea4-87c4-402b-a407-2c01fbc7e820.8c071d90-4909-4ab1-8f91-5280423b3dd6","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.427.13510798887943643.2aa534b4-72f5-4eaa-a59f-52a8c8700f31.f9de07b7-0868-4087-8a8d-f38cf67eac1f","Height":2160,"Width":1440,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["AkademGmbH.ParkourSimulator3D_gn2z3rcqm3jrj"],"ContentIds":["fd85d940-1a15-d74c-7fe0-5380ce54f865","b0ed90ab-7267-cd01-d54d-800f7160c031"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Enjoy FREEDOM - forget about limits, only action matters!\r\n\r\n**Parkour Simulator 3D: choose freedom, choose motion, choose thrill**\r\n**Express yourself in body language**\r\n**Perform amazing stunts, compete with rivals, participate in street parkour battles, train and develop your abilities**\r\n\r\nShow what you’re capable of in different game modes:\r\n- TIME RACE - \r\nRun and reach all checkpoints until the time runs out.\r\n\r\n- FIND CHECKPOINTS -\r\n Find all 5 checkpoints until time runs out.\r\n\r\n- RIVAL RUN - \r\nRun and reach more checkpoints first than your opponent!\r\n\r\n- TRICKS MODE -\r\nRun and perform various combos until the time runs out.\r\n\r\n- FREE RUN - \r\nExplore the map and train to control the character.\r\n\r\nChoose and customize your character and be #1 traceur.

Whilst simple in concept a good deal of strategy is required to complete the layouts.\r\n\r\nThe objective of the game is to remove all the tiles from a layout in the least possible time. Layouts can vary in pattern, size and shape. Tiles are removed in pairs and may only be removed if they are both free and match one another. Free tiles are ones that have no other piece touching the left, right or both sides and no tiles on top.\r\n\r\nWhilst all deals generated by Mahjongg are solvable you will need to remove pairs of tiles carefully to ensure you don’t stop the removal of remaining pairs. \r\n\r\nThis game is ad-funded.

Recall your childhood!\r\n\r\nLudo game that traces its lineage to 6th century India. Ludo is derived from game Pachisi. Ludo is also very similar to Spanish board game.\r\n\r\nLudo game has stayed popular throughout the ages, varying only a little in its game structure. This persevering game is now available for you to play in an all new modernized format, i.e. as a video game application.\r\n\r\nThe game is played between 2 to 4 players and you have the option of playing the game against the computer, against your friends, or even against people from around the world. The objective of the game is pretty straightforward; each player gets 4 tokens, these tokens must make a full turn of the board and then make it to the finish line.\r\n\r\nWhoever gets all four tokens to the end first is the winner. However, each move can only be made based on the number decided by casting a six-sided die, and each token can only move out of their home by casting a six. Additionally, the competition factor of the games is upped by the fact that while moving if another player’s token lands on the same square as your token, then your token will automatically be sent back home and you’ll need to roll a six again.\r\n\r\nLudo King is a game that was played by kings and now it can be enjoyed by you and your family and friends. While the game play might seem simple at first, the game is immensely enjoyable and challenging. You’ll be playing this one for hours and its fun for the whole family. Try to beat your opponents and compete for the highest scores on the leaderboards.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4SGHV","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Dragon Ball Paint","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36604.13510798887569491.0b4918a7-fd09-4afc-ac37-bdfcfad7609c.28ab24a3-4259-495b-9408-91ccb1c54a73","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#1D59A8","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60918.13510798887569491.0b4918a7-fd09-4afc-ac37-bdfcfad7609c.b56f2ae4-13e0-4070-be0b-ca01d16e2957","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"#1D59A8","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14062.13510798887569491.0b4918a7-fd09-4afc-ac37-bdfcfad7609c.6d58c23b-b3c2-40c9-a18f-6d6eecdaf051","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#1D59A8","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29155.13510798887569491.0b4918a7-fd09-4afc-ac37-bdfcfad7609c.ef578903-9dec-4fa9-9034-a7be4cfed69a","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#1D59A8","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17395.13510798887569491.0b4918a7-fd09-4afc-ac37-bdfcfad7609c.12f316bf-d135-4913-a7ac-7e46cecf6cdd","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#1D59A8","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.43406.13510798887569491.0b4918a7-fd09-4afc-ac37-bdfcfad7609c.cb9519c1-085f-4aa2-8a19-e00f611d3fcb","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#1D59A8","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38283.13510798887569491.0b4918a7-fd09-4afc-ac37-bdfcfad7609c.20a042e3-1885-4634-8e30-0b7828535285","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#1D59A8","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50569.13510798887569491.0b4918a7-fd09-4afc-ac37-bdfcfad7609c.77f8c83e-e72b-4478-88fd-3f0b78583fe8","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#1D59A8","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.12731.13510798887569491.0b4918a7-fd09-4afc-ac37-bdfcfad7609c.f31a02ad-efb8-4040-8823-31227d52f60f","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#1D59A8","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25959.13510798887569491.5315f652-c6a7-4da6-aa03-68501471bbbf.1345c8b0-cddb-48db-ab0b-4ee229ffd776","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#1D59A8","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["23268AppolloPaint.DragonBallPaint_skgegchsa453w"],"ContentIds":["2104011f-1a1c-7d87-789e-2cfcedd918f0","f42c5f93-35b5-7df3-fedf-3fbd3c98ed28","9e7e5d6b-5ccb-cc9a-c204-3007d6992fcf","01dc67f3-7640-986f-bf33-632b8982d3b5","c478663d-ae8f-09b4-2dfb-f01adbbeea94"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"A great painting app for kids who love Dragon Ball.
