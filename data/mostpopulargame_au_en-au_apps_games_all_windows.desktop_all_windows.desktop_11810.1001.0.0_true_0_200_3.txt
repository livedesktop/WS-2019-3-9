That’s why we have developed Multiplication Dragons, to provide new, fun ways to engage with multiplication that stimulate ease of memorization and improved recall. We all know how difficult it is to remember things without using the proper tools, and Multiplication Dragons provides just that. Our brightly colored, unique, three-dimensional environments provide visual and auditory spaces in which children can learn by associating multiplication questions with a rhyme, an in-game location, and the dragon that asks the question.\r\n\r\nMultiplication Dragons helps increase memorization and ease of recall using two memory devices that reinforce each other: rhyme and the memory palace (a.k.a. the method of loci). It will introduce your child to the world of multiplication using 3D animated dragons that guide them through 12 different environments, including a lagoon, a Halloween inspired level, a mountain, caves, a winter setting, and more! Each of the 144 questions is asked by one of our many dragons, stationed in various locations and levels throughout the game. Questions are asked using a phrase that both rhymes with the answer, and relates to the particular surroundings of the level currently being played. Multiplication questions also appear onscreen and are read aloud, a design feature used to help young readers and those experiencing difficulty reading, and to provide our dragons with a bit of extra personality. \r\n\r\nWe draw on rhyme because it has been used in various ways and has stood the test of time as a mnemonic device. After all, how many times has the age-old “thirty days has September, April, June, and November” rhyme helped you to recall the number of days in a month? It has been used for generations, and proven its success over and over again. Our second memory device, the memory palace, is one of the oldest and most successful tools in the book! This method goes back to the ancient Greeks, and involves imagining a familiar environment (like your home) and associating the things to be remembered with particular areas or aspects of that environment.  The visual and spatial qualities of this form provide additional contact points that aid in the creation of cognitive associations with the thing that we want to remember. This creates more access routes for our brains to get at the desired information, and thus increases ease of recall. By using both of these methods together we have increased these possible cognitive associations even further, while providing you and your child with hours of fun!\r\n\r\nChildren will earn 1-3 stars based on the amount of correct answers given on a level, giving them the opportunity to return to a level and break their current score. They will also get an encouraging cheer from our dragons for each right or wrong answer, and unlock new levels by successfully completing a timetable level. They can also make use of an added visual cue by reviewing the timetable itself, and test recall by attempting quiz mode. Here, your child must answer questions without the rhymes, and in random order, simulating a school math test. And unlike other games that offer one free level and then charge you for the remaining eleven, we ask for one payment which includes access to all twelve levels, quiz mode, and timetable mode.\r\n\r\nMultiplication Dragons provides your child with a whole world of exploration that introduces, reinforces, and tests multiplication skills, in a mode that feels like play. It’s time exchange the mechanical repetition of rote learning for techniques that make memorization easy and fun. Add some good-times to your tables, with Multiplication Dragons!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH587GB","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Lucky Block Maze","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33995.13510798886903197.4856f6fb-0dee-4535-8ed7-f8f55a1b30b6.6beec80e-bd3c-401a-a3a8-348414af349c","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38091.13510798886903197.491b412b-bb8d-4c3e-bd2f-231cb1ebe2d5.06995a90-1744-403b-a7ae-0d9b24ab8295","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"AU$2.95","Price":2.95,"AverageRating":3.0,"RatingsCount":"2","PackageFamilyNames":["18224boogygames.LuckyBlockMaze_3has56vqfsc8c"],"ContentIds":["42ce77bb-d514-17d9-fb75-cc14b6858883"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Create your own craft design with randomly generated maps.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH5Q5HG","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"HorseWorld 3D: My Riding Horse","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30580.13510798887146435.e8593520-9cc4-42aa-a080-d8d84e578801.9064813f-02fa-41e6-b0e6-a66a90f86d69","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#256E15","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4643.13510798887146435.a7246b25-0e85-43f4-b23d-b2aeb8c3ff66.1371e018-0b35-4198-962b-c0e180da58b6","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#256E15","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23658.13510798887146435.ebc7211d-eb34-49d7-b01b-9d91cd154957.9f98d53a-d1bc-4ef1-86ad-91e1e15d1cb4","Height":558,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#256E15","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24068.13510798887146435.5c29d091-2110-455f-8e5f-77c6adec88b2.cf1467e5-8d4c-4178-b5cd-9e573a9c09cb","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#256E15","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7003.13510798887146435.2de65e2b-2a8a-4319-8431-9f6e589a08f2.53645d20-3676-44d8-ab1e-8f7c0e6e8af5","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#256E15","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.16508.13510798887146435.ac10647b-2b0e-4a58-a185-a0787d0048af.ce0aa262-3628-4238-a55a-0e417aa14ac0","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#256E15","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"AU$2.95","Price":2.95,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["Tivola.HorseWorld3DPREMIUM_znpcaja5jk6zj"],"ContentIds":["0d5b3e13-e1f9-a8b4-836a-0412eeca69d5","554761c9-6504-9e29-06a3-3ec26021b90b"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"With \"Horse World 3D: My Riding Horse\" you're immersed in the world of the equestrian center.

After your child uses Friendly Maths a few times, the app will start choosing questions that gently challenge your child's ability without discouraging progress. The goal is to achieve that sweet spot where questions are not too easy and not too difficult to achieve maximum benefits.  \r\n \r\nMy motivation for developing Friendly Maths grew out of watching my two children interact with various Maths apps over the years. I noticed that some apps were too harsh on the kids, using negative scoring which resulted in a lot of tears and frustration. Other apps were timed games offering multiple choice answers. My concern with those was that kids learned to quickly press the correct buttons without much understanding of the subject matter.\r\n\r\nFriendly Maths was developed to address some of these concerns. With Friendly Maths, children are not timed in order to allow them time to think, consolidate knowledge, and truly understand problems. Incorrect answers are not penalized and the app often offers second chances. I believe that this approach encourages the spirit of learning and experimentation. Positive reinforcement is used, not negative scoring. This prevents children from forming negative attitudes towards Maths and protects their self-esteem. The apps' simple visual design helps children focus on Maths with minimal distractions, so that learning can easily be transferred into school testing and real life scenarios. \r\n \r\nFriendly Maths provides your child with rewards in the form of collectible achievements. For best effect, parents are encouraged to provide additional positive reinforcement by linking app achievements with additional rewards. You know best what works for your child, whether it is extra pocket money, screen time, taking them on a trip or nothing at all.  Each achievement is unlocked by answering 100 questions correctly, which can be done in a session or two. Ideally, your child should be encouraged to use the app a few times a week, so 3 or 4 achievements a week should be optimal. Again, a balance should be achieved here.  Too little use may not provide optimal benefits, but too much use may result in negative attitudes and fatigue. Again, you know best what is optimal for your child. \r\n \r\nFriendly Maths can be used by up to five children providing they are sharing a computer. It is important that every child is playing under his or her \"login\" as the app tailors questions to your child. If they have dedicated devices, you will need a separate license for each child.  \r\n \r\nFriendly Maths lets you install the app on multiple devices and the progress will follow your child as she changes devices. So, your child can start on one device and continue playing on another.  \r\n \r\nI have done my best to design Friendly Maths for special accessibility requirements, but I have limited resources for testing this. If you find something is not working optimally in terms of accessibility, please email me so that I can improve it. I am really keen to get this right!\r\n \r\nIf you encounter any bugs or problems, just drop me an email. I can usually fix issues quickly. No call centers here, I will personally reply to your emails.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDCW3S","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Myth Defense LF","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.50053.9007199266379585.cb4db00f-e7a3-46a5-8a0c-84ce15d6abea.1c2e8b33-2b9f-4479-a4ef-ef40a87862b5","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.13182.9007199266379585.21ffe9c2-053f-400c-9842-e80f018f633b.4313e5a8-8c17-4936-9904-3e153461df8b","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.10343.9007199266379585.dc0da412-ec68-4aa3-b960-605b1d717a5f.1afa4910-bb0f-40d9-bbc7-1c495210c8b3","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.13709.9007199266379585.4256f229-fc52-43bf-b9ba-6edd69778204.c7369028-83f2-4077-b34d-1be0294ab4fe","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.48657.9007199266379585.f0183881-e09b-4900-8ae6-80ab8e583c37.5621a987-68f3-425a-8bae-94b00fe519e0","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.23998.9007199266379585.258ca8c2-4572-4e66-a0b2-6e770d8fa19a.01acee62-c0b6-4dca-8136-9c086481df66","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"AU$2.95⁺","Price":2.95,"AverageRating":4.5,"RatingsCount":"2","PackageFamilyNames":["17631SmartpixGames.MythDefenseLF_rrjwnaqaqmgwm"],"ContentIds":["1f9f2759-bd6a-8ba8-a5a8-d082d4e933fd"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"\"Myth Defense: Light Forces\" (free ver. is available!) has the best elements of tower defense games and also includes such original features as alchemy, random maps, campaign and more. \r\nFull version features in brief:\r\n- Battle mode: 4 basic maps + random map\r\n- Achievements and ranks\r\n- Campaign: 18 maps; replay campaign many times to obtain prize and a higher rank\r\n- 2 independent profiles: Advanced and Casual\r\n- Various skills enhancements\r\n- 22 tower types + 3 special traps\r\n- Special characteristics of towers and enemies\r\n- Alchemy: create various runes to enhance your towers\r\n- Terrain features: use swamps, puddles, etc. to employ the best tactics\r\n- 33 levels of hardness\r\n- Multilingual interface\r\n- Panoramic sound on the battleground; original sounds and music\r\n- Online worldwide leaderboards\r\n- Interactive help items for beginners\r\n- New: there are three DLC addon maps are available in Battle menu section.

Take control of a whole country, like the USA, Germany, France, Russia, or Austria. Change laws, taxes and budgets based on real world statistics and data, and see what happens.\r\n\r\nThe game simulates a whole country: Population, debt, GDP, economic growth, unemployment, crime, life expectancy, birth rate, mortality rate, state of the infrastructure and so on. The player can adjust budgets, taxes, laws, and see what the outcome is. \r\n\r\nReal World Data\r\n\r\nThe game is running on real-world data. Meaning everything is based on real values: If you play as the USA, the debt, income, expenditures, crime rate, unemployment rate, etc. you start with is based on the actual, real values of the USA. For example if you lower a tax rate, you'll see what the simulation calculates as new values afterwards, in dollars, people, crimes per 100.000, interest rate, life expectancy in years, and similar.\r\n\r\nGameplay\r\n\r\nThere are goals to fulfill, like decreasing the crime rate or achieving a certain public health or education rating, but it is already interesting to try to tamper with the various options alone: What happens if you lower the minimum wage? What if you change the length of maternity leave? Or the retirement age? You can also do more serious changes like introducing censorship laws, compulsory military service, cash bans, or universal basic income.\r\n\r\nThere are military options, so you can start a war with any country in the world, and adjust its operation mode while the conflict is active. But be sure not to let it run out of control. Some countries for example also have a nuclear option, of course.\r\n\r\nThe game also includes a media and public relations system, where you can read the most interesting headlines, and try to influence the media with PR stunts, interviews, and similar. \r\n\r\nCountries\r\n\r\nYou can play as the USA, Germany, Russia, France, and Austria: These are the countries the simulation was implemented and tested to work nicely.

The computer game was originally created by Brodie Lockard in 1981 and named Mah-Jongg after the game that uses the same tiles for play. Lockard claims that it was based on a centuries-old Chinese game called \"the Turtle\". However, it was not until Activision released Shanghai in 1986 for the Macintosh and Apple IIgs that the game gathered momentum. A version of this game was also included in the Microsoft Entertainment Pack for Windows 3.x in 1990 and went by the name Taipei. It was subsequently included in the Best of Windows Entertainment Pack. Premium editions of the Windows Vista operating system and Windows 7 include a version of the game known as Mahjong Titans. \r\nAs any other successful game, millions of clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We tried to recreate all the fun of original game with 60 different layouts in a tiny download package. \r\nA tile that can be moved left or right without disturbing other tiles is said to be exposed. Exposed pairs of identical tiles (Flower and Seasons tiles in the same group being considered identical) are removed from the layout one at a time, gradually exposing the lower layers to play. The aim of the game is to clear the layout by pairing up all the tiles. The game is finished when either the layout is empty, or there are no exposed pairs remaining.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9N12Q11J8538","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Cake Shop Bakery Empire","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60445.13913783827032241.a7553d18-4548-4378-b60c-b7b0f17d1124.bbe53378-e22e-4830-a8d4-b203de45f6e9","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53769.13913783827032241.a7553d18-4548-4378-b60c-b7b0f17d1124.ef553d77-144e-49f3-bb24-60cd8921428f","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60445.13913783827032241.a7553d18-4548-4378-b60c-b7b0f17d1124.bbe53378-e22e-4830-a8d4-b203de45f6e9","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.2,"RatingsCount":"16","PackageFamilyNames":["39365PlayBestTalkingGames.CakeShopBakeryEmpire_9tkwm9hgzzx7y"],"ContentIds":["07b8fb2e-f86e-725a-9704-640930d2de9c","67ae2b88-bfe3-71f6-8176-626bd6f323c5"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Make a super delicious cake in my cafe cake shop!

It is fundamentally different from most solitaire games in that very few hands are unsolvable. Although software implementations vary, most versions label the hands with a number (derived from the random number seed used to generate the hand).\r\n\r\nA version of FreeCell was created by Microsoft for release with the Windows operating system.\r\n\r\nFreeCell solitaire is one kinds of funny solitaire card game, but it's not like other solitaires. You need no luck to win, only skill is required. All cards are opened from the start and the deal has the solution, you can win, think and move wisely. \r\n\r\nKey Features: \r\n- deals with different difficulty \r\n- every completed deal has score \r\n- customizable background and card \r\n- magnetic card movement \r\n- supermove: multiple card dragging \r\n- drag or tap to move \r\n- undo option \r\n- optimized battery usage for very long gameplay \r\n\r\nRules\r\nConstruction and layout\r\nOne standard 52-card deck is used.\r\nThere are four open cells and four open foundations. Some alternate rules use between one to ten cells.\r\nCards are dealt into eight cascades, four of which comprise seven cards and four of which comprise six. Some alternate rules will use between four to ten cascades.\r\n\r\nBuilding during play\r\nThe top card of each cascade begins a tableau.\r\nTableaux must be built down by alternating colors.\r\nFoundations are built up by suit.\r\n\r\nMoves\r\nAny cell card or top card of any cascade may be moved to build on a tableau, or moved to an empty cell, an empty cascade, or its foundation.\r\nComplete or partial tableaus may be moved to build on existing tableaus, or moved to empty cascades, by recursively placing and removing cards through intermediate locations. Computer implementations often show this motion, but players using physical decks typically move the tableau at once.\r\n\r\nVictory\r\nThe game is won after all cards are moved to their foundation piles.\r\nVarious computer versions of Freecell occasionally deal unsolvable games.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nOne of the oldest ancestors of FreeCell is Eight Off. In the June 1968 edition of Scientific American, Martin Gardner described in his \"Mathematical Games\" column a game by C. L. Baker that is similar to FreeCell, except that cards on the tableau are built by suit rather than by alternate colors. Gardner wrote, \"The game was taught to Baker by his father, who in turn learned it from an Englishman during the 1920s.\" This variant is now called Baker's Game. FreeCell's origins may date back even further to 1945 and a Scandinavian game called Napoleon in St. Helena (not the game Napoleon at St. Helena, also known as Forty Thieves).\r\n\r\nPaul Alfille changed Baker's Game by making cards build according to alternate colors, thus creating FreeCell. He implemented the first computerised version of it in the TUTOR programming language for the PLATO educational computer system in 1978. Alfille was able to display easily recognizable graphical images of playing cards on the 512 * 512 monochrome display on the PLATO systems.\r\n\r\nThis original FreeCell environment allowed games with 4–10 columns and 1–10 cells in addition to the standard 8 * 4 game. For each variant, the program stored a ranked list of the players with the longest winning streaks. There was also a tournament system that allowed people to compete to win difficult hand-picked deals. Paul Alfille describes this early FreeCell environment in more detail in an interview from 2000.\r\n\r\n\r\nSolver complexity\r\nThe FreeCell game has a constant number of cards. This implies that in constant time, a person or computer could list all of the possible moves from a given start configuration and discover a winning set of moves or, assuming the game cannot be solved, the lack thereof. To perform an interesting complexity analysis one must construct a generalized version of the FreeCell game with 4 * n cards. This generalized version of the game is NP-complete; it is unlikely that any algorithm more efficient than a brute-force search exists that can find solutions for arbitrary generalized FreeCell configurations.\r\n\r\nThere are 52! (i.e., 52 factorial), or approximately 8*1067, distinct deals. However, some games are effectively identical to others because suits assigned to cards are arbitrary or columns can be swapped. After taking these factors into account, there are approximately 1.75*1064 distinct games.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJCM9","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"FreeCell FREE","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.48618.9007199266251384.2dcfba61-94c3-4394-a846-dcaa94bc8671.5d0be557-841d-44ee-9634-13e0df5ef7a4","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#114621","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.30966.9007199266251384.4b5da019-614e-4b5a-b6ea-b5c548aa6d68.4af8b082-b084-48de-b45a-c2fce48619d5","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#114621","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.28963.9007199266251384.817824bc-dd11-47c0-a0cf-fc00b1bb99c1.340d6d81-099a-4a5e-867f-36e5e98e0a5f","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#114621","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14517.9007199266251384.3e14ddb7-ae2b-4950-892f-c459ccdbbb7a.ddb94a09-61ad-4a43-bb22-728954e7a54a","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#114621","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33537.9007199266251384.1ab85fae-984f-4414-8bb5-b56c34f11f94.07514fba-4784-4d6e-b4a8-964c913df5b1","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#114621","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.9675.9007199266251384.612bbb78-f106-4f04-86bb-127251f68ecb.8e0da3bc-fded-4206-8f4e-309c9f630eed","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#114621","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63416.9007199266251384.d41846a3-b1b9-4264-a933-34775222864c.2e2961dd-2df8-4ae3-abd6-963afc434cf2","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#114621","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63069.9007199266251384.74583e73-2f41-4a37-906d-ec1b04ee78df.a5a49040-f3ea-41fe-b01f-b64f459b5efb","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#114621","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":2.7,"RatingsCount":"11","PackageFamilyNames":["43248SummitDataCorp.FreeCellFREE_hmd3687kaknfw"],"ContentIds":["879e8a4f-0616-3d31-efc0-98540111e473","fdab1588-239a-258a-91a5-5244269285f3","fefb2add-6e80-2de1-db22-abbc2b7f4d41"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"FreeCell FREE contains all the features of a traditional FreeCell, plus the beautiful graphics made by CardLion.

The 2019 edition of Bridge features faster and stronger game play with smoother user interface.\r\n\r\nBridge is a card game played by four players who form two partnerships. Players within a partnership face each other across the bridge table. Traditionally, the players are referred to by the points of the compass - North, East, South and West. The two partnerships are North/South and East/West. Games are played to the best of three.  During bidding, each partnership exchanges information to decide a contract. Once established the cards are played with the declarer attempting to fulfill the contract + the opponents attempting to defeat it.\r\n\r\nBridge includes the all new state of the art advanced Bridge card play engine playing at a significantly stronger level. By analysing the probable permutations of the remaining cards Bridge will frequently find an extra trick to make or defeat a contract. \r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE:\r\nThis game is ad-funded.

The aim of the game is to get all of the cards in order (King to Ace). To win, you must remove all the cards from the table by building columns organized in descending order, from king to ace. At intermediate (2-suits) and advanced (4-suites) levels, the cards must also match suit. When you succeed in building a sequentially-ordered column, it flies off the table. If you run out of moves, click the pile at the bottom of the table to deal a new row of cards. \r\n\r\nIn our version we largely tried to recreate a full experience of that version in a tiny download package, along with multiple suite versions of the game, hints and undo (top right corner of the title bar). But there are also some minor twists to make it easier to play on a small factor mobile devices. In particular you don't have to select a card to move - drag and drop entire column - only appropriate cards will move, the rest will snap back. The scoring is also changed - only number of moves counted - the lower the score - the better.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJ19L","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Rat on a Snowboard","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34084.9007199266244531.f00b6670-bf77-4f09-af5b-d291dd0606ef.9a374ba2-127f-4e84-ab8e-cf287f2a077d","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#002030","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45769.9007199266244531.043d5ce6-9cf3-45b7-844d-bcb95ebc24ea.ccf8db84-f1ca-47e1-bf15-93cd1799d073","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#002030","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.8,"RatingsCount":"200","PackageFamilyNames":["DonutGames.RatonaSnowboard_pt1hwfcp9ekx8"],"ContentIds":["59b6e263-4fca-738c-de4b-6c41f7c4faf1"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"So, there's been a lot of speculation on what ride Ratty will try next!\r\nThe answer is FINALLY here... and it comes with a hefty portion of EXPLODING MEATBALLS.\r\n\r\nRAT ON A SNOWBOARD is a fast-paced, arcade style snowboarding game and part of the ever-popular \"Rat on\" series.\r\nControls are really simple, which makes it perfect for gamers of any age, but the roads ahead are not only filled with bonus items, but some challenging obstacles as well.\r\n\r\nDepending on which game mode you pick, you're up for the craziest runs against pine trees, tree stumps, giant snowballs, pointy icicles... and did someone say exploding meatballs?","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH6CH07","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Evo Explores","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28667.13510798886612620.29d00bc0-2503-45b0-bef0-ec6601b30850.a5c086ea-2503-4c99-9abd-746ad9544e74","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64337.13510798886612620.e3973445-0ad6-4eca-b883-4b8197b1d8d6.79ccfef3-5959-4de2-a15c-97ea978dcb30","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38204.13510798886612620.3b2a3777-fc74-44a0-bcbe-12bb9a2fabbf.3246c000-d49b-4a38-b5b7-cae492ddc1bb","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22016.13510798886612620.5f406b5e-5805-4591-8691-b4e45b0c9985.9bcbe18f-42c8-4b8f-8ddb-2db3920192e6","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"StrikethroughPrice":"AU$2.95","DisplayPrice":"AU$1.45","Price":1.45,"AverageRating":4.7,"RatingsCount":"7","PackageFamilyNames":["32363StampedeGames.EvoExplores_ssg7zgmzztv24"],"ContentIds":["fc74df49-252f-b628-0593-64be913ff25c","2d77e0a2-8d2b-7411-559e-a89d9224887e"],"Badges":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V3.ProductBadge, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","StyleKey":"Default","Text":"SAVE AU$1.50","Type":"Merchandized"}],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"• In Evo Explores you should trust your eyes.
